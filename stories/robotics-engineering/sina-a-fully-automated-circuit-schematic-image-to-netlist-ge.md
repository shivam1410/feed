arXiv:2607.01609v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have revolutionized Electronic Design Automation (EDA), particularly through Large Language Models (LLMs) for circuit design tasks. However, their application to analog and mixed-signal domains remains limited by the lack of machine-readable representations of existing circuit design knowledge. Circuit schematic images found in research manuscripts, textbooks, and websites constitute a vast repository of validated designs; however, these visual representations cannot be directly processed by EDA tools. Converting them into machine-readable netlists is essential for enabling simulation, verification, and building comprehensive databases for AI-based models. Current conversion methods lack generalization across both Integrated Circuit (IC) and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) level schematics. Moreover, they struggle with component recognition and connectivity inference, and fail to distinguish between connected junctions and crossing wires. In this paper, we propose SINA, an open-source circuit schematic image-to-netlist generator. SINA is a fully automated pipeline that integrates deep learning for robust component detection, connected-component labeling for accurate connectivity inference, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for component reference designator extraction, and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for reliable reference designator assignment. SINA handles both IC- and PCB-level schematics and incorporates dedicated crossing-wires detection to differentiate wire intersections from connections. We validate the correctness of the generated netlists using graph isomorphism techniques. Our experiments demonstrate an overall netlist generation accuracy of 96.67%, which is 2.72x higher compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
