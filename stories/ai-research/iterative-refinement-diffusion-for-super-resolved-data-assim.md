arXiv:2608.14744v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recovering high-resolution states from sparse, low-resolution observations is a central challenge in scientific machine learning and data assimilation. Classical data assimilation exploits temporal information through forecast-analysis cycles, but often requires repeated access to expensive high-resolution forecast models. Generative super-resolution can recover unresolved structure from coarse observations, but is commonly used as a one-shot mapping that does not fully exploit constraints from past states. We introduce Iterative Refinement (IR), a learned data assimilation framework that combines these perspectives. Instead of performing a single coarse-to-fine reconstruction, IR decomposes the task into resolution-wise forecast-analysis operations across a multiresolution hierarchy. At each stage, a shared neural operator with resolution-dependent spectral mode slicing provides a dynamical prior, while a shared conditional diffusion corrector uses the current coarser-resolution state to produce a refined posterior at the next finer resolution. We evaluate IR on one-dimensional stochastically forced Burgers dynamics and two-dimensional Kraichnan turbulence. On the challenging 256x256 Kraichnan benchmark, IR achieves an RMSE of 0.184 and an SSIM of 0.836, outperforming spectral upsampling, one-shot diffusion super-resolution, enhanced deep super-resolution, and an autoregressive forecaster. On the more constrained Burgers testbed, IR remains competitive with one-shot diffusion, which achieves the lowest RMSE. These results show that one-shot generative reconstruction can be effective for simpler settings, while hierarchical forecast-analysis refinement becomes advantageous in strongly multiscale and underdetermined regimes. Overall, IR combines temporal priors, generative correction, and multiresolution reconstruction for learned data assimilation in complex physical systems.
