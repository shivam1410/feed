Recent Omni-Modal Generative Models (Omni-Models) have advanced content generation toward unified modeling of text, images, video, and audio. MiniMax-H3 exemplifies this transition by combining multimodal context understanding with joint audio-visual generation in a shared latent framework. Its unified architecture raises a fundamental question: Can multimodal alignment improve the model's world reasoning, and what new evaluation paradigms do omni-modal inputs enable? To investigate this question, this work introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework organized around four complementary dimensions of physical world reasoning. Unlike existing evaluation frameworks for video generation and world models, which are often constrained by limited input modalities and evaluation settings where prompts closely match the target video content, our evaluation is specifically designed to exploit the multimodal inputs of Omni-Model. We construct a diverse set of novel tasks that require models to integrate complementary information across modalities. Specifically, we consider four scenarios, including implicit prompts paired with multiple frames, audio-image, prefix-videos, and audio-video inputs. Every single modality provides only partial evidence about the underlying event, requiring the model to jointly reason over the complementary semantic cues to infer latent event states and future dynamics. Across 517 evaluation instances, MiniMax-H3 achieves an overall success rate of 41.97%. Video-based Decision Reasoning yields the highest success rate at 56.00%, while Audio-based Disambiguation Reasoning is the weakest, reaching only 27.40%. These results indicate that effective multimodal integration remains key to fully exploiting the benefits of diverse input modalities.
