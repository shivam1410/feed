As multi-agent systems enter high-stakes domains, the possibility that agents may circumvent safety boundaries is a growing concern. Prior work has examined this risk primarily in adversarial settings, where agents are instructed or rewarded to communicate covertly and evade oversight. We show that benign agents can cross the same boundaries without adversarial incentives. We emulate a software-engineering workflow in which a planner represents a company hiring an external developer. The planner writes requirements and holds a company credential it is instructed not to disclose to the developer; a monitor screens their exchanges. Seven of nine tested frontier models disguise the credential in their requirements to help the developer recover it while evading the monitor, even after completing their assigned objective. For example, across 6,000 episodes with DeepSeek-V4-Pro, the planner attempts concealment in 16.9%; in 0.9%, the credential evades the monitor and is recovered and used by the developer. Despite the low per-episode rate, the risk compounds across repeated exchanges: at 0.9%, 105 independent episodes carry a 61.3% chance of at least one breach. Our analysis suggests that the planner misinterprets disguised disclosure as helping the developer and reads the nondisclosure rule as banning plaintext, not character codes or riddles. We call this behavior covert assistance. Monitoring favors concealment, while concealment gives way to direct disclosure when the recipient is presented as a human rather than an AI agent, so leakage persists. Giving the monitor the credential improves detection but requires trusting it with the secret. These risks, in models already used for software engineering, challenge oversight to distinguish authorized cooperation from task-advancing assistance that crosses safety boundaries.
