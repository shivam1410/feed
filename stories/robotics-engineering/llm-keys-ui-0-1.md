Release: llm-keys-ui 0.1 This plugin solves a very specific problem. I've started using Codex Remote to run coding agents on various machines while controlling them from my phone. Sometimes I use those machines to hack on LLM projects, and occasionally that means I need to configure an API key. I don't like pasting API keys into agent sessions, so I wanted a way to get those keys onto a machine without pasting them into the ChatGPT app directly. With this plugin, I can tell Codex to run: uvx --with llm-keys-ui llm keys-ui --all Then have it tell me the URL - including local network or Tailscale device IPs - for an interface to save additional API keys. Then later it can use a command like llm keys get anthropic as part of a shell command when it needs to use a key. Tags: llm , coding-agents , codex
