arXiv:2607.06630v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Formal robustness certificates for embedded neural-interface models can pass while task accuracy collapses: at perturbation budget e=0.25, EEGNet classification accuracy drops by 25.7% under projected-gradient attack while the Lipschitz-style certificate remains valid for all 9 tested subjects. We argue that this gap between mathematical certification and operational safety is one instance of a broader alignment failure in neural interfaces, where training objectives diverge from user welfare. We propose a unified empirical audit framework organized around three such failures: verification insufficiency, in which certificates pass while task behavior degrades; proxy-fidelity divergence, in which task-optimized representations damage neural signal structure (a time-domain auxiliary objective reduces reconstruction MSE by 0.1132 while worsening spectral log-MSE); and latent information exfiltration, in which public-task embeddings retain private attributes (subject identity recoverable at 48.1% versus 6.7% chance). We instantiate the framework on BCI Competition IV 2a and SEED-IV using multiple deep and classical EEG decoders, official session-level validation, null controls, and paired statistical tests. The verification gap persists across EEGNet, CSP+LDA, and FBCSP+LDA, and is therefore architecture-independent. Our results establish that operational safety auditing, not certificate verification alone, is necessary for responsible neural-interface deployment.
