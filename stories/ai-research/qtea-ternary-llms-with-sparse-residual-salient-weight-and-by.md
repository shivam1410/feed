arXiv:2609.00224v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) can alleviate the computational burden of serving large language models (LLMs) at scale. However, existing PTQ methods often fail to generalize across models and suffer severe accuracy loss below 2 bits. Many leverage unstructured sparsity to mitigate this loss, but at the cost of regularity and GPU-friendly execution. We present QTEA, a sub-2-bit PTQ framework that quantizes weights into ternary values and uses salient weights as residual error compensators. To maintain hardware efficiency, residuals are assigned to selected columns with semi-structured \(1{:}4\) sparsity within the salient columns. We further add column-wise rescale refinement to GPTQ-style column-by-column quantization, alternately updating per-column scales and ternary assignments to reduce reconstruction error. We also identify order-dependent error propagation in GPTQ and introduce error decay to attenuate late-stage error accumulation. On Qwen3-14B, QTEA compresses all weights to an effective 1.7 bits per weight while improving average accuracy over the strongest ternary PTQ baseline by 16.7\%. It also achieves 1.40\(\times\) and 2.61\(\times\) lower perplexity on WikiText and C4 respectively. This trend holds on Llama3-8B, where QTEA obtains a 6.6\% accuracy gain and 1.34\(\times\)/1.95\(\times\) lower perplexity on the same datasets. Finally, we develop a lookup-table based kernel that achieves 7.2\(\times\) faster per-token generation over an FP16 baseline.
