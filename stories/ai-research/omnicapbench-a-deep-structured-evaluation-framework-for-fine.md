Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving toward continuous audio--visual reasoning, creating an urgent need for evaluations that expose their capability limits. Audio--visual captioning is an ideal diagnostic task, yet current benchmarks face a coupled trade-off: whole-caption scores provide coverage without localization, local probes provide localization without coverage, and unconstrained LLM judges introduce instability. We introduce OmniCapBench (Omni-Video Caption Benchmark), a benchmark that reframes audio--visual caption evaluation as a deep-structured diagnostic framework. OmniCapBench shifts the prediction target from free-form text to sets of atomic, verifiable evaluation units across three tracks: entity references, visual shots, and audio events, enabling reliable scoring with deterministic constraint checks and localized LLM-based semantic comparisons. With 786 densely annotated videos, OmniCapBench effectively distinguishes MLLM perception errors, including temporal grounding failures, identity drift, cross-modal misalignment, and hallucinated descriptions. Evaluating frontier MLLMs reveals strong local perception but weak long-horizon audio--visual reasoning, particularly in identity drift and cross-modal misalignment, providing a fine-grained roadmap for omnimodal development.
