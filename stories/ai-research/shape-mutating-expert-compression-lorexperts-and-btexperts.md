arXiv:2608.07814v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models deliver high capacity at low per-token compute, but deploying them cheaply requires compressing their many expert weight matrices. Expert pruning (e.g., REAP) and merging reduce cost but sacrifice accuracy and require retraining the router; low-rank delta decomposition of experts (e.g., D^2-MoE) preserves all experts and the router, but degrades sharply as the expert count grows because a single shared component cannot approximate many near-orthogonal experts. Because MoE expert weights are near-orthogonal, a single shared component (as in prior delta decomposition) scales poorly with the expert count; we show that experts nonetheless organize into functional co-activation communities that are decoupled from weight similarity. Building on this, we introduce LorExperts, a router-preserving compression method that clusters experts, keeps one full-precision dominant per cluster, and represents the remaining members as low-rank corrections to their local dominant. LorExperts retains all experts and the original router (no router retraining). At ~50% expert compression on Qwen3-30B-A3B and Gemma-4-26B-A4B, LorExperts preserves downstream accuracy and perplexity better than the baselines on most of the tasks; the margin over D^2-MoE grows with expert count E. We further give a reconstruction fine-tuning procedure for LorExperts, and BTExperts, a tree organization of dominants and corrections that enables inference-time amortization of shared computation.
