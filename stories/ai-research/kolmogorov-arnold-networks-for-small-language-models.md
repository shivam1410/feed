arXiv:2607.15525v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) replace fixed node activations with learned one-dimensional edge functions, offering an explicit interface for interpretation and a possible alternative to transformer feed-forward networks. We test these claims separately. In a six-layer, 10M-parameter B-spline KAN, we reconstruct all 884,736 feed-forward edges: 87.8\% exceed (NLS>0.1) and 0.4\% are inactive. Pruning the lowest-activity 20--25\% causes negligible loss increase, although structured MLP neuron pruning tolerates comparable sparsity. The audit replicates on BabyLM, but grid-size sweeps show that near-total fPCA compression and high closed-form-fit coverage are properties of the low-capacity grid-2 basis, not universal KAN behavior. For replacement, we evaluate MLP, SwiGLU, grouped Chebyshev, and rational GR-KAN networks on BabyLM. The KAN-family and gated variants improve validation loss over the GELU MLP, but this ordering does not transfer to standardized benchmarks: across ten seeds and 59,875 BLiMP pairs, accuracies span 62.4--63.1\%, EWoK remains at chance, and a (+0.7)-point GR-KAN effect on BLiMP reverses on the supplement. Larger tests are also cautionary: parameter-matched MLPEdge underperforms the MLP on Wikitext-103, and 286M-parameter GR-KAN remains below a SwiGLU ClimbMix baseline after stabilization. Thus, small-basis KANs provide a practical, corpus-transferable interface for auditing learned scalar transformations, but the tested replacements show no consistent benchmark, quality, or latency advantage over strong MLP baselines.
