Image guardrails are typically trained and evaluated under a fixed safety policy, implicitly treating safety as an intrinsic property of an image. Real deployments are different: the same image may be allowed in one product, restricted in another, and newly disallowed when a policy boundary changes. We study policy-adaptive image guardrailing, where a model must decide whether an image violates the currently supplied policy and generalize to held-out policy definitions. We introduce PolicyShiftBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 2,000 policy-discriminative instances over 265 images, where each image is paired with 7.55 policy-conditioned prompts on average to test whether models adapt to the active policy rather than relying on image-level safety priors. We then propose PolicyShiftGuard, a compact policy-conditioned guardrail trained with a two-stage training recipe that combines Randomized Policy SFT (RP-SFT) with Boundary-Pair Policy Adaptation (BP-Adapt). BP-Adapt trains matched prompts for the same image and risk category using standard label supervision and a pairwise comparison loss that separates blocking policies from passing policies. Experiments show that existing VLMs and specialized guardrails remain brittle under policy shifts, while PolicyShiftGuard substantially improves policy-sensitive performance. The 7B model achieves SOTA performance of 76.9 Avg. F1 and 72.1 Avg. PSS on PolicyShiftBench, transfers well to UnSafeBench and SafeEditBench, and improves the latency-performance trade-off with a concise output format. Ablations confirm that matched pass/block boundary pairs are essential for stable policy adaptation.
