Memory has evolved into a foundational architectural dimension in large language models (LLMs), shifting from an implicit byproduct of computation to a spectrum of explicit, controllable mechanisms. While recent advances introduce diverse strategies---spanning transient attention, recurrent state dynamics, parameter-efficient adaptations, and scalable lookup storage---this rapid evolution has led to a highly fragmented research landscape. In this survey, we present a systematic, architecture-centric taxonomy of memory in LLMs. Our framework characterizes memory along three orthogonal axes: representation (implicit versus explicit), update dynamics (offline versus online), and persistence (short-term versus long-term). We further formalize the granular mechanisms dictating memory writing, routing, state transitions, and consolidation. This unified perspective elucidates the conceptual boundaries between computation-coupled and independently addressable memory, effectively bridging disparate architectural paradigms. Additionally, we critically analyze hybrid memory architectures, system-level efficiency trade-offs, and multi-dimensional evaluation methodologies. By consolidating these scattered advancements into a cohesive framework, this survey charts the trajectory of memory-centric LLM design and provides a principled foundation for future innovations in scalable and adaptive language modeling.
