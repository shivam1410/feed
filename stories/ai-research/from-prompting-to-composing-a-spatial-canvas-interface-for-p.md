Text prompting is an indirect interface for poster generation, requiring users to encode inherently two-dimensional composition intent into a one-dimensional sequence of words. We introduce a Spatial Canvas Interface that enables users to directly compose generation intent in space through four complementary binding types: semantic, identity, text, and pixel, together with Text Specifications for individual elements and global appearance. Based on this interface, we develop Compo, a poster generation model adapted from a pretrained image editing model to understand Spatial Canvas inputs and Text Specifications. Compo supports both direct inference, where users explicitly construct the canvas, and agentic mode, where a high-level request is automatically translated into a planned Spatial Canvas. To train Compo, we develop a scalable pipeline that automatically constructs supervision data for different binding types and their combinations, enabling efficient adaptation without training a specialized poster generator from scratch. We further introduce a benchmark that evaluates adherence to individual binding types and their joint composition. Experiments show that Compo achieves stronger compositional controllability than both general-purpose image generation models and dedicated poster generation systems while maintaining high visual quality. By decoupling intent specification from visual generation, our work shifts poster generation from prompting toward composing.
