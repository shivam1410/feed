arXiv:2607.15835v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Big data clustering remains challenging: the Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering (MSSC) problem underlying K-means is NP-hard, and existing methods either reach poor local minima or require prohibitive metaheuristic hybrids. We target arbitrarily tall data: a fixed feature space may contain arbitrarily many, possibly infinitely many, observations, while the algorithm accesses only finite random samples. We propose Big-means++, an algorithm achieving scalability and global-search quality by curating inputs to MSSC optimization on big data. It orchestrates local K-means refinements into a data-native global search for big data clustering. Rather than optimizing the full-data MSSC objective, Big-means++ traverses sample-induced surrogate landscapes. Each sample defines a distinct empirical MSSC approximation with a perturbed local-optimum structure, turning sample-to-sample variation into a global-search mechanism. Unlike Big-means, a flowing-incumbent strategy propagates centroid state across empirical landscapes through K-means refinements on fresh samples without rollback to a best-so-far solution. This increases mobility and favors stable, high-quality configurations across approximations of the full-data structure. A new shaking mechanism varies sample size geometrically, broadening the surrogate landscapes explored across resolution scales, accounting for cluster imbalance, and improving solution quality. A competitive multi-agent system asynchronously explores independent sampled landscapes, transforming diverse stochastic trajectories into collective search intelligence. Automatic convergence detection stops each agent after attaining a high-quality solution but before further search risks degrading it, while providing a universal speed-quality control. Experiments on 22 datasets against 11 competing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of Big-means++.
