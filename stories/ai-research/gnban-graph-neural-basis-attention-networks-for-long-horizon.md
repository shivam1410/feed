arXiv:2606.27863v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Demand forecasting at the bottom of a retail hierarchy requires predicting tens of thousands of correlated long-horizon series across products, stores, and regions. Modern systems must scale across massive catalogs, capture shared demand dynamics, and remain interpretable enough to be trusted. Classical statistical methods need a separate model per series and are hard to manage at scale; deep autoregressive models struggle as the joint state grows to tens of thousands of dimensions; and recent graph-based forecasters, while capturing cross-entity dependencies, often produce opaque long-horizon forecasts. We propose GNBAN (Graph Neural Basis Attention Network), an end-to-end architecture combining heterogeneous graph representation learning with an interpretable basis-decomposition head. Retail data are represented directly as a heterogeneous graph derived from the relational schema, so a single model serves the entire catalog. Rather than predicting the horizon directly, GNBAN decomposes each forecast into trend, seasonal, and generic components. Its key innovation is a per-basis attention mechanism: each basis function keeps its own learnable query and retrieves information independently from the entity's historical neighborhood, letting different bases specialize to distinct temporal patterns while preserving interpretability. On two large-scale benchmarks, M5 Walmart and Favorita Grocery Sales, evaluated under matched protocols, GNBAN improves volume-weighted WRMSSE by roughly 4-5% over a matched graph baseline. Qualitative analysis shows the learned decomposition exposes trend, seasonal, and residual demand drivers without post-hoc explanation methods. These results demonstrate that scalable relational forecasting and interpretable forecast decomposition can be achieved together in a unified graph-based framework.
