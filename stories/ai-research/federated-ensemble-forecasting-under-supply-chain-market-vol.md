arXiv:2608.21399v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Supply chain forecasting systems increasingly operate under market shocks, non-identically distributed regional demand, and limited willingness to centralize commercial data. This work proposes Federated Ensemble Forecasting with Negative-Correlation Learning (FEF NCL), a distributed method that trains specialized forecasting experts across client nodes while discouraging redundant model errors. The framework combines temporal feature encoders, client level drift scoring, reliability-weighted aggregation, and an explain ability layer that exposes the market and supplier variables most responsible for each forecast. A single synthetic dataset is used to evaluate the design. It contains 124,800 weekly SKU region observations from ten regional client nodes, 60 product families, 40 suppliers, five commodity groups, and a 2021-2024 volatility profile with explicit price-shock regimes. Because the dataset is synthetic, the reported results should be interpreted as controlled evidence of internal consistency rather than real-world validation. Across the synthetic test split, FEF NCL reduces weighted mean absolute percentage error from 13.9% for the best federated baseline to 12.4%, improves delay-risk macro-F1 from 0.755 to 0.801, and lowers the high volatility quintile error by 2.1 percentage points relative to SCAFFOLD. The analysis suggests that negative-correlation specialization is useful when clients face different supplier, freight, and commodity conditions, although deployment would require stronger privacy analysis, live drift monitoring, and operational calibration.
