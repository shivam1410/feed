arXiv:2609.09786v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor-imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) vary across subjects and sessions, complicating personalization from limited calibration data. Federated learning can exploit shared representations without centralizing raw EEG, but existing federated MI studies largely assume regular synchronization. We introduce NEXUS-MI, a gateway-coordinated federated personalization framework that treats synchronization as a coupled learning-and-communication control problem. Raw EEG and classifier heads remain local, while an edge coordinator maintains the shared backbone. We evaluate NEXUS-MI through offline replay using BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a (BCICIV-2a; 9 subjects, 4 classes) and OpenBMI (54 subjects, 2 classes). Session 1 supports backbone learning, and Session 2 provides limited-calibration personalization and held-out testing. An ideal-link reference and six heterogeneous-link policies characterize gateway participation, buffering, stale-update admission, and backbone-download control. The principal comparison holds delayed-update handling fixed while contrasting non-adaptive and communication-aware synchronization. Paired subject-level comparisons use Holm adjustment, and robustness across five matched realizations is assessed by hierarchical bootstrap. Communication-aware coordination reduced server-to-client backbone traffic by approximately 42% on both datasets, while cohort-level accuracy differences were small and realization-dependent. Cohort averages also concealed subject-level vulnerability, with losses reaching approximately 12 percentage points on BCICIV-2a relative to the ideal-link reference. These findings establish gateway synchronization as an explicit design variable in federated MI personalization and motivate joint evaluation of personalized accuracy, communication cost, update freshness, and subject-level reliability.
