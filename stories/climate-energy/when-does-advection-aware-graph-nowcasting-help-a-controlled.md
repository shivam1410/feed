Short-term forecasting of cloud-induced power ramps across a network of distributed photovoltaic (PV) or irradiance sensors is a recognised pain point for grid operators. A natural idea is to make the graph neural network (GNN) advection-aware: connect each site to the sites upwind of it, with edge time-lags set by the cloud-motion vector (CMV), so that a ramp is propagated forward before it physically arrives. Using a controlled synthetic testbed with a known wind field, we show that (i) with a realistic cross-correlation CMV estimate, an explicit advection graph does not beat a plain static or learned-adjacency spatiotemporal GNN; (ii) roughly half of the benefit available from a perfect CMV comes simply from providing an accurate motion vector as an input feature, not from graph structure; and (iii) advection helps only when the advective displacement over the forecast horizon, v*H, fits inside the sensor network. Motivated by (ii), we introduce a small self-supervised cloud-motion estimator -- a position-aware encoder trained only on a multi-lag optical-flow reconstruction objective with an annealed kernel -- that recovers the true wind vector to 2-4 degrees median angular error, 2-4x better than the classical cross-correlation method across every wind regime. Freezing this estimator and feeding its vector to the forecaster closes about 60% of the oracle-CMV RMSE gap at moderate wind (8-15% RMSE reduction over no advection), with no external wind data. We also report a negative result for a spatially-coherent probabilistic head. All claims are established on a single synthetic simulator; we discuss why real-network validation is the necessary next step and outline it.
