arXiv:2607.23054v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses key-value pairs through a shared low-rank bottleneck (cKV), achieving 81% KV-cache reduction during inference. Despite its adoption in massive production models, no prior work has studied what information this bottleneck preserves or discards, nor how it reshapes internal transformer circuits. We present the first comprehensive mechanistic interpretability study of MLA, training a 114M-parameter transformer (pretrained on a web/code/math mixture, fine-tuned on TinyStories) and analyzing its representations through SVD, attention head taxonomy, linear probing, and a disruption-attribution analysis. Our key findings are: (1) the cKV bottleneck learns a pure content representation, preserving entity identity (98% retention) while discarding positional information, validating MLA's separation of content from position via RoPE; (2) induction heads co-locate at a single layer (Layer 12), unlike their distributed formation in standard MHA; (3) a single "semantic hub" layer (Layer 15) simultaneously exhibits the highest SVD effective rank and strongest disruption-attribution score; and (4) the bottleneck is globally over-provisioned, using only 46% of its capacity on average. These findings suggest MLA does not merely compress attention passively, but reshapes how the model organizes content, position, and circuit structure. We view this as an initial data point and detail scope limitations in Section 5.
