arXiv:2609.02155v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma guarantees that a random projection of $n$ points to $m=O(\varepsilon^{-2}\log n)$ dimensions preserves pairwise squared distances within relative error $\varepsilon$ with high probability, and this dimension order is asymptotically optimal. In high dimensions, however, distances concentrate around a baseline while key geometric information lies in much smaller fluctuations. We show that the JL bound can therefore be uninformative about retained geometry: an independent Gaussian replacement map can satisfy it even though the replacement cloud is independent of the original data. We then ask how well any decoder can recover a feature $f(D)$ of a squared distance $D$ from a linear sketch. Under squared-error loss, the optimal decoder is conditional expectation, so recovery defines a linear operator whose singular values quantify feature recovery. For isotropic Gaussian data ($\Sigma=\sigma^2 I_d$), we diagonalize this operator in closed form. For fixed $k$ with $m,d-m\to\infty$, its $k$th singular value satisfies $\ell_k\approx(m/ d)^{k/2}$. This yields three sharp consequences. A rank-$m$ sketch retains at most an $m/d$ fraction of the variance of any feature of one squared distance. If $m\to\infty$ and $m/d\to0$, the expected Kendall correlation is $\frac{2}{\pi}\sqrt{m/d}(1+o(1))$; for fixed $q$, nearest- neighbor agreement tends to $1/q$. Yet one projection can satisfy the JL bound while mean Kendall correlation vanishes when $\log n\ll m\ll d$. After removing scale, Haar-averaged retained covariance-shape information is $(m/d)^2$. Thus JL distance preservation does not quantify the geometry available for comparison or inference.
