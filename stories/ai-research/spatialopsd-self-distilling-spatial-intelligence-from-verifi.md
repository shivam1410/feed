Spatial coding agents significantly improve spatial reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by using external tools to generate verified execution traces. However, this paradigm inherently suffers from prohibitive inference-time overhead and external dependencies. In this paper, we explore whether an MLLM can internalize this agentic capability to operate entirely tool-free. We begin with a simple observation: prompting an MLLM with summarized execution traces of a spatial coding agent naturally unlocks the model's internal spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Motivated by this, we introduce SpatialOPSD, an on-policy self-distillation framework that internalizes spatial reasoning into a standalone MLLM by formulating verified agent traces as privileged information. To mitigate privileged-information leakage during distillation, we introduce Repetition-Aware Distillation, which combines repetition masking with unlikelihood regularization. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that self-distilling SpatialOPSD achieves higher average accuracy than SFT and GRPO on both spatial and OOD datasets, exhibiting superior performance and generalization.
