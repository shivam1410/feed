Release: llm 0.32rc1 This RC for LLM 0.32 finishes the work that started in LLM 0.32a0 - it adds a new schema design that does a much better job of capturing the details of the prompts and responses returned by the latest model families. The most important change is the use of content-addressable hash IDs for stored messages. This allows de-duplication in the database, and means that LLM can now represent trees of messages for forked conversations. Since it involves a significant schema change - new tables only, and old data should not be affected at all - it's worth running a backup of your existing logs.db before upgrading to the RC: llm logs backup logs-backup.db The RC also adds support for gpt-5.6-sol , gpt-5.6-terra , and gpt-5.6-luna .
