arXiv:2607.22545v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Deploying large language models in financial-services and agentic settings requires safety classifiers that simultaneously handle prompt injection, regulatory compliance, and general harm, a combination no existing open guardrail addresses in a single inference pass. Semalith v1.4 is a 184M-parameter DeBERTa-v3-base classifier performing simultaneous three-axis safety classification including prompt injection, general harm, and financial-services regulatory compliance, in a single forward pass. Its 22-class head (BENIGN, nine prompt-injection sub-types, general-harm, eleven BFSI labels) is trained with a 4-class auxiliary super-category head under jointly weighted loss, on a 76,204-row corpus mined from 49 public sources with SHA-1 deduplication against every held-out evaluation set, with 21 of 22 benchmarks at zero contamination (max 0.22%). Against Llama-Guard-3-8B on 22 held-out benchmarks, Semalith v1.4 wins every prompt-injection evaluation (7/7) and 11 of 18 benchmarks overall at 44x fewer parameters, with FPR = 0.000 on 208 benign agentic prompts vs 0.063 for Llama-Guard-3-8B. On general-harm benchmarks (WildGuardMix, HEx-PHI, HarmBench), Llama-Guard-3 leads; this complementary split is documented in Section 4. Six measured weak spots are disclosed in Section 6. Deployment guidance: v1.3 is recommended for conversational moderation deployments (ToxicChat F1 0.624); v1.4 is recommended when BFSI label coverage or zero-FPR on benign agentic prompts is the priority.
