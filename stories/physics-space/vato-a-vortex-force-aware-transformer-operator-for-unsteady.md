arXiv:2609.00507v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Accurate prediction of unsteady separated flows is challenging because the aerodynamic loads depend on nonlinear separation and vortex-shedding dynamics. Although high-fidelity CFD resolves these mechanisms, its cost limits repeated use in design and control. Standard field-level surrogate training, however, does not distinguish the flow regions that contribute most strongly to the aerodynamic loads. We introduce VATO (Vortex-Force-Aware Transformer Operator), which couples the Vortex Force Map (VFM) method to a geometry-aware neural operator through two complementary mechanisms. VATO-S adds training-only supervision of the local VFM force-contribution field, with no increase in model size or inference cost. VATO-A uses VFM contribution and sensitivity fields to prioritise force-relevant source locations for residual cross attention. The methods are evaluated on unsteady CFD data for double-edged-plate aerofoils over 54 trajectories from nine geometries. Over lead times of 1-20~ms, VATO-S reduces velocity, pressure, and vorticity errors by 10.4\%, 1.0\%, and 15.6\%, respectively, while VATO-A achieves reductions of 15.8\%, 7.5\%, and 31.2\%. VATO-S gives the lowest VFM-derived drag error, whereas VATO-A gives the lowest pressure-derived lift and drag errors. Over lead times extending 50\% beyond the training range, VATO-A retains a 26.9\% reduction in vorticity error and larger improvements in all four force readouts, despite reduced gains in velocity and pressure. These results show that force-aware operator learning can improve both flow-field prediction and aerodynamic functional accuracy in unsteady separated flows.
