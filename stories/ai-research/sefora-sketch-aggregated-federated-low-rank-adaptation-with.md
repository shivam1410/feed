arXiv:2608.10144v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We consider federated parameter efficient fine-tuning of large neural networks with low-rank adaptation (LoRA,~Hu et al.\ 2022). Combining LoRA with federated PEFT introduces challenges absent from either setting alone: clients may use different LoRA ranks, making their factor matrices dimension-incompatible, and factor-wise averaging suffers from a bilinear mismatch. We propose SeFoRA, a sketch-aggregated federated LoRA algorithm in which each client transmits a linear sketch of its local updates, enabling direct aggregation at the federator. As a result, SeFoRA alleviates the bilinear mismatch, and allows for aggregation in a small subspace of the full model. We introduce a rank-homogeneous version called SeFoRA-Ho which allows for direct adapter aggregation in this setting. We prove convergence to a neighborhood of the first-order stationary point at rate $\cO(1/T)$ for the rank-homogeneous setting. Numerical experiments on fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large on GLUE datasets show how our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art.
