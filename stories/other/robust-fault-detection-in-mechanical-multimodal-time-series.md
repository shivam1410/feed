arXiv:2609.16314v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Fault detection is essential in industrial systems, enabling early identification of abnormal behaviour and improving safety, reliability, and operational efficiency. Modern systems increasingly rely on heterogeneous sensing modalities that capture complementary aspects of the underlying physical process. However, existing data-driven anomaly detection methods often process each modality independently or use simple feature-level fusion, limiting their ability to exploit cross-modal relationships that characterize normal system behaviour. Their performance also commonly assumes similar training and deployment distributions, whereas real-world operation is affected by changing operating conditions, environmental influences, and system degradation that induce distribution shifts and reduce detection performance, especially in unseen regimes. In this work, we propose a multimodal anomaly detection framework based on cross-modal reconstruction of heterogeneous time-series sensor data. Rather than modeling each modality independently, the framework learns system dynamics by reconstructing each modality from the others, thereby exploiting complementary information across modalities. This integrates information across sensing channels without requiring explicit temporal alignment or identical sampling rates, while improving robustness to sensor noise, missing measurements, and modality-specific disturbances. To address distribution shifts during real-world deployment, anomalies are identified using cross-modal reconstruction error and an adaptive test-time thresholding mechanism that adjusts to changing operating conditions. Experiments on three industrial case studies show strong fault detection performance and substantially improved robustness under out-of-distribution conditions, with the largest gains observed in the most challenging operating regimes.
