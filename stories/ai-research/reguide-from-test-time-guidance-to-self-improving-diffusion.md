arXiv:2606.28939v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Behavior-cloned diffusion policies are expressive but remain vulnerable to covariate shift: small deviations from demonstrated states can compound into task failure. Existing methods address this either by expanding the training distribution through expert corrections or synthetic augmentation, or by steering a frozen policy at test time with guidance from a learned model. The former can be expensive or assumption-dependent, while the latter discards the corrected trajectories after execution. We introduce ReGuide, a self-improving framework that treats guided rollouts as reusable on-policy recovery data. ReGuide first uses Phase-Conditioned Guidance (PCG) to generate corrective rollouts: it constructs phase-specific latent targets, applies guidance only in the drifted-but-recoverable regime, and guides through the estimated clean action to match the dynamics model's training distribution. Successful guided rollouts are then absorbed back into the policy through ReGuide-FT, which fine-tunes the current checkpoint, or ReGuide-FS, which retrains from scratch on the augmented dataset; the two can also be composed and iterated. On Robomimic Can, Square, Transport, and Tool Hang, ReGuide improves base-policy success by $1.3$--$7.7\times$, outperforms LPB in the test-time-only setting, and matched-data ablations show that the gains come from guided recovery data rather than additional rollouts alone.
