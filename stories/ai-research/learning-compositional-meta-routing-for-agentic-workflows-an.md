arXiv:2608.00106v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Agentic systems must decide not only what answer to produce, but which reasoning and execution operations should precede it. A controller may answer directly, decompose a request, retrieve evidence, execute code, delegate to a specialist, or verify an intermediate result. Existing routing work largely selects model endpoints, retrieval depth, or tools in isolation. We introduce an executable benchmark and a budget-aware meta-router that composes heterogeneous operations from raw task text. The benchmark contains 216 training, 72 development, 108 held-out test, and 108 locked lexical-shift challenge tasks across data analysis, frozen-corpus research, and document processing. Outcomes are machine checked after operations execute. Independent regularized logistic heads predict operation probabilities from word and character features, are temperature-scaled on development data, and are greedily composed under route-cost and action-count budgets. On the held-out test, the learned policy achieves 100% success versus 93.5% for strong static and fixed workflows, with 43% lower cost than the static policy; a matched learned one-shot router reaches 56.5%. On the untouched challenge split, learned success falls to 75.9% and trails static routing at 93.5%, while remaining 49% cheaper and exceeding one-shot routing by 34.3 points. The gap identifies lexical generalization, rather than route execution, as the principal limitation. These results establish a reproducible testbed and a bounded proof of concept, not evidence of live-LLM performance.
