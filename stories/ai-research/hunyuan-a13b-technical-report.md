We present Hunyuan-A13B, an open-source large language model based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture. It contains 80 billion total parameters but activates only 13 billion during inference, balancing model capability, computational efficiency, and deployment cost. The model is pretrained on a rigorously filtered 20T-token corpus with enhanced STEM data curation, improving factual reliability and reasoning ability. High-quality supervised fine-tuning and large-scale reinforcement learning further enhance its overall performance. Hunyuan-A13B also introduces a dual-mode Chain-of-Thought framework that adapts reasoning depth to task complexity: fast thinking for routine queries and slow thinking for complex, multi-step problems. Evaluations show competitive performance across mathematics, science, programming, general language understanding, and agent tasks, often approaching that of much larger models. Its high inference throughput makes it suitable for latency-sensitive applications. We release Hunyuan-A13B to support open research and practical LLM deployment.
