arXiv:2607.21776v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Talking-face (TF) deepfake generation synthesizes photore- alistic facial video from a static source image and an au- dio signal, producing forgeries that current image-based detectors consistently fail to identify. Unlike face-swap ma- nipulation, TF synthesis has no underlying real video from which to inherit physiological characteristics, making re- mote photoplethysmography (rPPG) a uniquely motivated detection modality for this forgery category. We propose a detection framework that extracts per-video rPPG wave- forms via RhythmFormer and trains a suite of lightweight classifiers to distinguish real from synthesized physiologi- cal signals. Evaluated on the TF subset of Celeb-DF++ un- der a strict subject-independent protocol, where test identi- ties are completely separated from training identities, our 1D ResNet achieves an AUC of 0.806 and EER of 27.8%, placing it within 2.4 points of the best published general- purpose detector (Effort, ICML 2025) while operating ex- clusively on the physiological channel. We document a con- trolled reproduction study of DeepFakesON-Phys, the rep- resentative prior rPPG detector, demonstrating degrada- tion from AUC 0.999 on legacy face-swap data to 0.622 on the TF subset of Celeb-DF++. We further show that detec- tion difficulty is strongly method-dependent: AUC ranges from 0.985 (Real3DPortrait) to 0.690 (IP-LAP) across the seven TF generators, with the ranking remaining perfectly stable across all evaluation protocols. This spread reflects an interpretable physiological property of each generator rather than evaluation noise, and constitutes the primary theoretical contribution of the work.
