Recovering executable CAD programs from 3D meshes is challenging due to the compositional nature of CAD construction and the interaction between discrete modeling choices and continuous parameters. Many learning-based methods predict complete programs in a single pass and rely predominantly on sketch-extrude representations, limiting operation diversity and opportunities to correct geometric errors during reconstruction. We introduce StepCAD, a generative optimization approach that combines a state-conditioned CAD policy with geometry-guided search. Given an input mesh, the policy predicts construction actions conditioned on both target and intermediate geometry, and an IoU-guided tree search refines the resulting program through local edits. We also introduce ARCADE-1.5M, a large-scale dataset of 1.5M executable CAD programs spanning diverse operations, sequences with a maximum length of 150+ counted operations, and 12.5M intermediate state-action transitions. Experiments across multiple CAD reconstruction benchmarks show that StepCAD achieves state-of-the-art geometric reconstruction accuracy with consistently high validity, yielding up to 87.2% relative IoU improvement over the strongest evaluated baseline, with particularly large gains on complex shapes.
