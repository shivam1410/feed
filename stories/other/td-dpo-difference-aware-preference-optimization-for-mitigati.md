arXiv:2607.18304v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The sycophancy of large language models can increase the safety risk in intervention dialogue for autistic children. Supervised fine-tuning can somewhat reduce sycophancy, but relying solely on positive examples is often insufficient to identify and correct failure patterns. We observe that sycophancy behaviors can often be localized to a limited span within the model response. In this regime, sequence-level preference optimization can over-update preference-irrelevant tokens and degrade intervention ability. To address this, we propose the \textbf{M}inimal \textbf{E}dit \textbf{D}ata \textbf{A}ugmentation (MEDA) strategy to construct controlled, stable, minimal edit preference pairs and \textbf{T}oken-level \textbf{D}ifference \textbf{D}irect \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (TD-DPO), which upweights difference tokens between chosen and rejected responses while downweighting shared tokens to suppress background drift. Extensive experiments across multiple backbones and evaluators show that TD-DPO achieves a better trade-off between sycophancy mitigation and intervention ability retention in our offline settings, highlighting its potential as a practical alignment approach for autism intervention.
