Computer-use agents are increasingly evaluated in realistic desktop environments, but existing benchmarks provide limited coverage of professional engineering workflows whose outputs are persistent, structured artifacts. Mechanical computer-aided design (CAD) is a particularly demanding setting: an agent must manipulate geometry and constraints over long interaction horizons while producing a native project whose dimensions, construction structure, and downstream engineering state remain valid. We introduce CADWorld, a benchmark for long-horizon computer use in FreeCAD. CADWorld contains 200 tasks spanning 11 mechanical-CAD workflow categories, including sketching, part modeling, assembly, CAM, FEM, measurement, mesh processing, and technical drawing. Agents operate through screenshots and GUI actions, while success is determined by task-specific executable checks over saved FreeCAD artifacts and auxiliary outputs, covering geometric properties, parametric structure, constraints, manufacturing state, and simulation results. Across seven current agents on the full benchmark, the strongest agent achieves 17.5\% success, compared with an 87.0\% expert reference pass. We find that weaker agents often fail before producing a valid artifact, whereas stronger agents increasingly fail on structural, geometric, and construction-process requirements. CADWorld therefore exposes a gap between general GUI competence and reliable execution of persistent, verifiable engineering workflows. Project accessible at https://cad-world.github.io.
