arXiv:2607.15810v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Rollout generation is a major bottleneck in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models, motivating low-precision rollout acceleration such as FP8. As an emerging low-precision format, NVFP4 combines fine-grained scaling for accuracy preservation with native W4A4 FP4 GEMMs for higher throughput than FP8. However, we find that directly applying NVFP4 to MoE RL rollout is impractical. NVFP4 rollout with BF16 training collapses after roughly 150 steps, accompanied by rapidly growing rollout-trainer log-probability gaps. Through training-inference error analysis and controlled ablations, we identify activation error, rather than weight error, as the dominant source of FP4 RL instability: weights can be synchronized and aligned by a shared quantization-dequantization path, whereas activations are recomputed online and error is amplified by the coarse E2M1 grid. Therefore, to stabilize NVFP4 RL for MoE, we propose QUantization-error Alignment across Dual Sides (QUADS). On the trainer side, we introduce Asymmetric Quantization-Aware Training fake-quantizing weights while keeping activations unquantized for better alignment. On the rollout side, Residual Activation Compensation corrects high-error activation channels while preserving native W4A4 GEMMs. In our MoE RL experiments on several benchmarks, QUADS achieves BF16-level accuracy, improves average pass@1 by 21.49 points over naive NVFP4 RL, and delivers ~16% higher rollout throughput than FP8.
