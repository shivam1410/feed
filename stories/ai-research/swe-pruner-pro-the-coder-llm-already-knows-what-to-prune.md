Pruning long context for coding agents has been a vital technology for efficient context management. While existing context pruning methods such as SWE-Pruner realize this by attaching a separate code classifier, we find the agent itself encodes internal representations indicating the relevance of code context when reading tool output. Based on this finding, we propose SWE-Pruner Pro, which prunes tool outputs directly inside the agent. Concretely, a small head turns the agent's own internal representations into a keep-or-prune label for each line, with a length-aware embedding keyed to each tool output's line count. Across two open-weight backbones and four multi-turn benchmarks, SWE-Pruner Pro saves up to 39% of prompt and completion tokens while preserving task quality, with bounded inference overhead. Notably, on MiMo-V2-Flash SWE-Pruner Pro additionally raises the SWE-Bench Verified resolve rate by +3.8% and the long-context Oolong accuracy by +2.2 points.
