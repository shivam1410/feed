arXiv:2608.04074v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Long-context LLM decoding reads the key-value (KV) cache at every step. Loading it takes longer than computing attention over it, so throughput is bandwidth-bound. Hence, reducing the cache size can raise both decoding speed and serving capacity. The challenge is to reduce cache size while preserving the attention products, keeping reconstruction cheap, and using a fixed per-token bit count. At two bits per element, the most competitive methods rely on orthogonal transforms. However, existing techniques are either data-oblivious or use the query statistics without deriving the transform from a distortion criterion. Moreover, they rely on transforms built on top of random or Hadamard rotations, which equalize variances across entries rather than compacting energy, and fixed-width scalar quantizers, which are suboptimal at low rates. In this paper, we formulate KV cache quantization as a transform coding problem in which distortion is the error in the attention products. We derive closed-form optimal transforms for keys and values from calibration statistics, under a high-resolution model. We show that the optimal key transform is not orthogonal and satisfies a generalized Parseval relation: the attention-aware distortion becomes mean-squared error (MSE) in the transform domain. Thus, we can use MSE-optimal vector quantizers applied directly to the transformed key coefficients. To meet the fixed-width layout requirement, we show that grouping coefficients into equal-volume partitions makes equal-size codebooks attain the variable-rate optimum under the same high-resolution model. At two bits per element, our method, termed NOVA-KV, recovers most of the long-context retrieval accuracy lost by scalar quantization methods at comparable throughput.
