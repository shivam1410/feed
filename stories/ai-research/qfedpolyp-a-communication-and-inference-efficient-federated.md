arXiv:2607.22743v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Background and Objective: Automatic polyp segmentation supports computer-aided diagnosis and early colorectal cancer detec- tion. Centralized deep learning requires hospitals to share sensitive medical data, while federated learning preserves privacy but introduces high communication costs through repeated transmission of full-precision model parameters. We propose QFedPolyp, a communication- and inference-efficient federated learning framework for collaborative polyp segmentation. Methods: QFedPolyp combines quantization-aware training with low-precision model communication. Each hospital locally trains a lightweight U-Net on private data while simulating quantization during training. Clients transmit quantized model parameters to a central server, where they are reconstructed and aggregated using Federated Averaging. Evaluation is performed on Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicVideoDB, PolypGen, and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp. Results: Full-precision federated training achieves Dice scores of 0.910 on Kvasir-SEG and 0.930 on CVC-ClinicVideoDB. Uni- form 8-bit communication reduces transmission cost by approximately 4 times while preserving competitive segmentation accuracy. Quantized models also achieve up to 1.5 times faster inference than full-precision models. Conclusions: QFedPolyp enables privacy-preserving collaborative polyp segmentation with reduced communication overhead and faster inference. The resulting lightweight models are suitable for real-time clinical deployment.
