arXiv:2608.08103v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Smooth acyclicity constraints answer whether a weighted support is a DAG, whereas structure learning asks which support change should be made. Existing analyses establish degeneracy for particular constraint formulas but do not isolate what follows from smooth exactness itself. At a DAG boundary, we show that minimal cycle completions generate a squarefree monomial ideal containing every restricted Taylor jet of an exact representation. If the smallest completion has $q$ edges, the first possible response has order $q$ for a vector residual and $2q$ for a nonnegative scalar. Exponentially many constant-scale cyclic manifolds exhibit the same lack of ranking away from the boundary for NOTEARS and DAGMA. We derive the exact selection time for an isolated cycle. When $\Psi'(h)\asymp h^\nu$, the feasibility-only time is $T_0(\varepsilon)=\Theta(\varepsilon^{-(2\nu+1)})$; a score margin changes the leading dynamics at scale $T_0^{-1}$ for $\nu>0$, while $\nu=0$ has a logarithmic boundary layer requiring $\gamma T_0\log(1/\varepsilon)\to0$. Experiments verify this law, and a truth-free separation statistic predicts selection time on 320 official NOTEARS/DAGMA trajectories (Spearman $-0.52$ and $-0.66$, permutation $p<10^{-4}$). For finite samples, a parent-set confidence family and forced-opposite queries certify skeleton and unshielded-collider labels shared by every population optimum of a frozen score. Across 320 runs, every regret bound covers an independent oracle-score audit. None of 3,042 certified skeleton or 2,396 collider labels disagrees with the oracle-score optimum, although 4.4% and 5.5%, respectively, disagree with the generating graph. These results separate DAG feasibility, score-based support selection, and causal identification.
