arXiv:2608.14198v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Banks analyse sequential financial transaction data to perform many tasks, including fraud prevention, credit risk assessment and offer personalization. To improve the predictive accuracy of these tasks, Payments Foundation Models encode transaction sequence data as rich contextual embeddings, which can then be provided to task-specific models as features. However, these Foundation Models are not designed for flexible zero-shot reasoning across novel downstream prediction tasks, limiting their adaptability and utility. Existing LLM-based approaches to zero-shot prediction often fail to fully exploit the predictive signal within transaction data, while relying on costly text serialization or task-specific architectures that scale poorly. To address these limitations, we present the Multimodal Instruction Network for Transactions (MINT), a framework that connects a pretrained transaction sequence encoder to a decoder-only LLM through lightweight embedding injection, transaction-language alignment, and instruction tuning. We find that MINT achieves state-of-the-art predictive question-answering performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution questions, while substantially reducing input tokens, latency, and memory consumption compared to text-serialization baselines. Through comprehensive analyses of representations, alignment strategies, training data, and history length, we establish that compact transaction embeddings are a superior approach to transaction representation than text serialization for multimodal reasoning and zero-shot prediction tasks.
