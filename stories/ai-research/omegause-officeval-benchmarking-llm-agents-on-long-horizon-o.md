Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly expected to assist users in completing tasks. However, existing benchmarks provide limited support for evaluating whether agents can carry out office-suite workflows at a reasonable cost. We introduce OmegaUse-OfficeVal, a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon office-suite tasks with task-level economic grounding. The benchmark comprises 100 tasks derived from office-suite requests proposed by practitioners and adapted through a privacy-preserving process. On average, these tasks require 2.32 hours of human labor to complete. An important feature of the benchmark is that each task is paired with two economic signals: human labor time and task price proxy. These signals enable direct comparisons between human costs and LLM inference costs, as well as value-weighted evaluation. To support stable evaluation, we develop code-based verifiers from fine-grained rubrics. We evaluate several frontier LLMs together with a human baseline. Although all evaluated LLMs are substantially cheaper and faster than human workers, they have not yet approached human-level deliverable quality. The code and dataset are fully open-sourced, and more information is available on our project website: https://omegause-officeval.github.io.
