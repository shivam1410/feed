arXiv:2607.26523v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce CMP (Cognitive Memory Primitive), a continual-learning architecture that repre?sents inputs as sparse relational codes, stores them in a two-tier competitive memory, and learns through local updates without end-to-end backpropagation through its feature-generating system. We investigate whether combining sparse representations, local learning, and persistent memory can reduce catastrophic forgetting relative to conventional backpropagation-based continual?learning approaches. On a controlled domain-incremental byte-level language modeling protocol, CMP demonstrates substantially lower backward transfer than a parameter-matched Trans?former trained with online Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). Across a three-seed replicated 15-domain experiment, CMP exhibits stable forgetting behavior, while separate head-to-head comparisons and domain-order analyses show consistently lower forgetting than the evaluated Transformer baseline under the reported experimental settings. We report these findings alongside a substantial single-domain accuracy gap relative to the Transformer, a null result on a vision benchmark, and a documented failure to combine CMP with an independent accuracy-improving mechanism, reflecting our commitment to reporting both positive and negative outcomes. These results suggest that the combination of sparse representations, local learning, and persistent memory is a promising direction for continual learning, while motivating further investigation into the respective roles of learning rules, representations, and architectural design in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
