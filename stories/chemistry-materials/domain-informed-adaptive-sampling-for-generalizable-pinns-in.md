Accurate thermal modeling is essential in metal additive manufacturing (AM) for understanding the process-structure-property chain. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer effective surrogate thermal modeling by minimizing physics-based residual losses at collocation points. However, prior works typically rely on manually-crafted, static collocation sampling strategies, which are neither principled nor scalable across process conditions, hindering their generalization capability. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis through empirical risk minimization, showing that process condition-aware adaptive sampling is strictly more favorable than conventional static sampling for generalization. Building on this insight, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy within a two-stage framework: (1) a conditional Flow Matching model that learns approximate high-residual distributions across different process conditions, and (2) a mixed sampling strategy combining this distribution with a domain-informed base distribution to generate adaptive collocation points for refining the PINN predictor. Experiments on metal AM numerical benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PINN baselines, achieving an average 62.1\% reduction in relative $L_2$ error under an identical collocation budget, by capturing process-dependent heat dissipation regions often overlooked in the literature. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first adaptive sampling strategy for PINNs in metal AM, contributing to the enhanced generalization and broader applicability.
