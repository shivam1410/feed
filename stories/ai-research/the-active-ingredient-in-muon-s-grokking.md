arXiv:2607.20512v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Muon optimizer reaches the grokking threshold on modular arithmetic faster than AdamW. Prior work attributes this to "spectral-norm constraints plus orthogonalized momentum" but does not isolate which mechanism matters. To better understand Moun's behavior, we run multi-seed and multi-learning-rate sweeps to decompose and stress-test the effect. First, an ablation shows the speedup comes from orthogonalization (the Newton-Schulz iteration): orthogonalize-only matches full Muon, whereas spectral-only is no faster than AdamW and is unreliable, and this verdict holds across learning rates. Second, a mechanistic analysis finds that orthogonalizing optimizers reach generalization at roughly 3x lower spectral norm and, controlling for how much the embedding actually moves, settle into a lower-norm solution rather than simply perturbing the embedding less. Third, reducing the Newton-Schulz iteration count from five to one accelerates reaching the threshold but makes the grokked solution fragile, prone to transient collapse, with fragility that grows with learning rate; a single iteration is fast and stable only at small learning rate, while the canonical five iterations are the learning-rate-robust choice. We also show spectral scaling can be dropped at no measured cost. A methodological thread runs throughout: under a stability-aware metric, "faster" claims about grokking optimizers can invert, so we report both first-crossing and sustained-grok times. To support reproducibility, we release our full training and analysis code at https://github.com/louiswang524/muon-grokking-frontier
