arXiv:2608.19748v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Inference-time selection methods, such as Best-of-N, improve generation by sampling a pool of candidates and selecting the top-ranked completion according to a reward model. Distillation seeks to amortize this procedure into a single policy by replacing raw rewards with in-pool ranks and learning a policy that upweights higher-ranked completions. However, existing rank-based policies typically use smooth full-support reweighting, so low-ranked completions receive less mass but remain in the target support. Although a sharper reweighting reduces lower-tail mass, it also increases reliance on brittle ranking at the top made by a single reward model. We propose TUP: a Truncate-bad, Upweight-good Policy that removes low-ranked completions from the support and reweights only the retained upper tail with a tunable sharpness. TUP admits a closed-form, prompt-independent normalization and can be trained fully offline via binary cross-entropy, using shifted-truncated win-rates as soft labels and distilled-to-reference log-likelihood ratios as logits. Theoretically, under certain assumptions, we show that for any unknown oracle reward, the best monotone rank-reweighting can be matched by a lower-tail truncation rule, providing formal support for removing the lower tail rather than merely downweighting it. Empirically, we show that TUP is competitive with strong offline alignment baselines.
