arXiv:2607.16248v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Long-context large language model inference relies on the KV cache to avoid redundant attention computation, but incurs high memory and bandwidth overheads. Low-bit KV-cache quantization reduces this cost, yet it severely degrade quality; particularly, one-bit quantization reduces accuracy from 84.2% to 47.8% on Llama-3.1-8B under RULER. Rather than common beliefs that absolute error of logits, we find that the root cause is structured local misranking, where the distribution of logits in top-K region is drifted. We thereby propose local distribution restoration, a new technique that detects steps with high local distribution risk from quantized-logit features and restores only the selected top-K candidate distribution before token selection. We implement DGAP to achieve local distribution restoration, with efficient risk detcetors and correctors. Expeirments show that on Llama-3.1-8B, DGAP recovers K1V1 RULER accuracy from 47.8% to 83.2% and reduces distribution drift from 0.38 to 0.14; across Llama, Mistral, and Qwen models, it preserves the persistent low-bit KV-cache footprint with modest decode overhead.
