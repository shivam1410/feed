arXiv:2607.20552v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Grokking -- the delayed generalization of neural networks long after they have memorized their training data -- wastes thousands of training epochs and is notoriously unpredictable. Building on the recent result that Transformer attention is formally isomorphic to a thermodynamic system, we treat the variance of attention logits as a specific heat Cv and show that its peak reliably precedes the generalization transition. We introduce CvAdamW, a drop-in AdamW variant that monitors Cv online and injects thermal energy by dynamically scaling weight decay when a phase transition is detected. Through a strictly iterative development process we identify three failure modes -- initialization noise, mini-batch micro-ripples, and slingshot blinding -- and resolve them with a memorization gate and an exponential-moving-average shock absorber. On modular arithmetic (a+b mod 97), CvAdamW enables grokking at epoch 2802 in a 4000-epoch budget where the baseline never groks. We further propose a scale-invariant z-score reformulation that removes task-specific hyperparameters, and evaluate it across 10 paired seeds. A paired analysis shows the cold-start variant reduces mean grokking latency by 257 epochs (6.0%; median 166 epochs; Wilcoxon p=0.049, Cohen's d=0.68, bootstrap 95% CI [53,489]), improving 8 of 10 seeds; on this single task Cv peaks before grokking in all 10 seeds. Our results indicate that neural networks may expose detectable precursors of impending generalization transitions, and that a physically motivated, proportional intervention can facilitate generalization within a fixed compute budget. Code and data are public.
