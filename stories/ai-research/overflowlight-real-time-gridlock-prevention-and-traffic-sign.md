arXiv:2606.27381v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Queue overflow, a severe consequence of urban traffic congestion, occurs when vehicle queues exceed intersection capacity, obstructing upstream traffic and triggering cascading gridlocks. Prevailing traffic signal control (TSC) algorithms, primarily optimized for throughput, often fail to address overflow during peak hours, exacerbating congestion and creating safety hazards. We propose OverFlowLight, a real-time framework designed to preemptively resolve overflow and enhance overall TSC performance. It first introduces a mechanism to accurately detect overflow in real-time by leveraging multi-modal sensing from cameras and radars. Upon detection, it dynamically generates and inserts dedicated overflow phases into the signal cycle to clear the blocking queues. This is orchestrated by a hybrid control design that combines rapid rule-based overflow intervention with controller back ends such as reinforcement learning (RL) for longer-horizon efficiency. We conducted extensive real-world deployments of OverFlowLight across 43 intersections in three major cities. The framework demonstrates seamless integration with existing RL-based TSC agents, highlighting its modularity and practical applicability. Empirical results show that OverFlowLight reduces overflow incidents by 60.4% and increases network throughput by 18.2% compared to deployed baselines. Furthermore, it substantially diminishes the need for manual intervention common with expert-tuned signal plans. This work presents the first practical, scalable, and data-driven framework for actively preventing traffic gridlock, offering a crucial component for building resilient and efficient urban transportation systems.
