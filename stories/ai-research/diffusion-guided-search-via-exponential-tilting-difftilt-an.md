arXiv:2607.23134v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Discovering rare safety-critical failures in autonomous and cyber-physical systems is a fundamental challenge in verification and validation. Existing falsification approaches rely on conditional sampling strategies that factor the joint distribution over environments and system executions, and therefore suffer from multiplicative rarity effects: the simultaneous scarcity of failure-inducing inputs and failure-inducing traces makes exhaustive search prohibitively expensive. This paper develops DiffTilt, a distributional framework that exponentially tilts a diffusion model-induced joint distribution over environments and executions. We show that diffusion-guided sampling admits an exact interpretation as importance sampling in the joint space, where guidance scores induce a KL-optimal reallocation of probability mass towards failure-relevant behaviors. We further show that tilting provably amplifies failure probability and strictly outperforms conditional sampling, which is limited by multiplicative rarity. In this framework, the joint generative model serves as a reusable prior over scenarios and need not faithfully represent the system under test. Expensive system simulations are instead limited to learning a scoring function that characterizes scenario quality, enabling their selective and adaptive use. We study DiffTilt on ARCH-COMP benchmarks, and we propose an additional tractor-trailer benchmark showing the behavior of several approaches when scenario generation is guided by a well-defined specification rather than a reward. The proposed method achieves competitive or improved falsification performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with larger gains when specification definition is not limited to STL formulas.
