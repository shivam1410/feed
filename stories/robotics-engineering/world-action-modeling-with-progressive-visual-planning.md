World action models (WAMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for robotic control by jointly predicting future visual dynamics and actions from an initial observation and instruction. However, existing WAMs struggle with long-horizon prediction, as generating dense video rollouts is highly inefficient. Some recent WAMs address this by predicting a single future frame without generating the full video, but this approach neglects how to progress toward the goal. We present ProWAM, a progressive world action model that jointly predicts actions and an ordered sequence of sparse visual sub-goals, providing explicit visual guidance to anchor action generation throughout task execution. This design scales naturally, as sub-goal prediction can be learned from large-scale action-free videos, allowing the video backbone to offload complex visual planning from the action policy. For efficient action generation, ProWAM executes a single video-backbone forward pass to cache sparse sub-goal features, eliminating iterative full-video generation and requiring only lightweight action denoising during replanning. Across extensive evaluations, ProWAM achieves superior out-of-distribution robustness. On simulation benchmarks, it sets new state-of-the-art results on LIBERO-Plus (85.8%) and randomized RoboTwin (75.7%), outperforming the strongest baseline with relative gains of up to +35.9%. On RoboCasa365, ProWAM achieves a 48.1% success rate and 18.2% on the challenging Composite-Unseen split, ranking 4th overall. Crucially, in zero-shot real-world experiments, ProWAM achieves 70.0% success, outperforming the strongest baseline by +15.0 (from 55.0% to 70.0%, a +27.3% relative gain) in novel scenes. These results demonstrate the value of progress-indexed visual foresight for closed-loop control. Our program is in https://sii-ferenas.github.io/ProWAM-page.
