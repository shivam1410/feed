arXiv:2607.01279v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Cross-subject EEG stress detection remains challenging because discriminative stress-related patterns are both subject-dependent and frequency-specific. Conventional Riemannian methods model spatial covariance mainly in the time domain, overlooking neural oscillations that are critical for high-level cognitive state decoding, while standard temporal tokenization often fragments inter-slice temporal coherence. To address these limitations, we propose \method{}, an Intra-Inter Riemannian Manifold Attention Network for EEG-based stress detection. \method{} constructs spatial covariance matrices independently at each frequency point and maps them to the SPD tangent space, preserving channel-wise geometry together with frequency-specific discriminative cues. It further introduces frequency cluster aggregation to select informative spectral components and reduce redundancy by forming compact, data-driven frequency clusters aligned with EEG rhythms. Finally, an intra-inter slice attention module adaptively integrates local slice-level spectral dynamics and global temporal context across EEG sequences. Experiments on three datasets show that \method{} consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 82.78\% balanced accuracy while remaining efficient with only 1.60M parameters and 31.95M FLOPs.
