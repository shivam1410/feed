Length-penalized reinforcement learning can shorten chain-of-thought reasoning while hiding an influence that drives the model's answer. In our experiments, training with length penalties does not stop misleading hints from steering models, even though the models' chains of thought mention the hint much less often. A token-accuracy evaluation would count these runs as successful because they use fewer reasoning tokens with little accuracy loss; it would miss whether the remaining trace still shows what drove the answer. We train Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-14B variants with different target chain lengths, then evaluate them with biasing-hint interventions on held-out MMLU-Pro-R and four transfer benchmarks. Compression sharply cuts reasoning tokens, preserves most multiple-choice accuracy, and leaves hint influence near baseline. At the strongest target, lower-bound faithfulness falls to 63.1% of baseline for Qwen3-14B and 69.4% for Qwen3-4B; the raw rate at which a monitor catches hint use falls from 69% to 49% and from 60% to 48%. To separate length from content, we randomly delete sentences from uncompressed baseline chains until the remaining text matches the compressed length. Even after this length matching, compressed chains disclose the hint 7-35 percentage points less often than baseline chains that we shorten at random, for both Qwen3 sizes and all five evaluation distributions. Compression therefore does more than shorten reasoning, preferentially removing the cues a monitor needs to see what influenced the answer. Together, these results reveal a compression-monitorability frontier in which cheaper reasoning can preserve answers while making the influences behind them harder to detect.
