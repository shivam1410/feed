Claude Sonnet 5.5 New Sonnet model from Anthropic today. They say it "runs 30%+ faster, and costs up to 30% less for most work" - it's priced the same as Sonnet 5 but appears to beat it on every benchmark, and should be cheaper to run as well. Here are some pelicans riding bicycles . Sonnet 5.5 suffered from the same bug as Opus 5.5 : the "max" thinking effort pelican thought for 128,000 tokens (at a cost of $1.28) before running out of tokens and failing to produce an SVG. Here's the pelican it gave me for thinking effort "xhigh", at a cost of 5.74 cents and taking 41 seconds: Sonnet 5.5 appears to be almost as good as Opus 5.5 on some coding tasks, including various viral 3D animation tricks . The most interesting thing about Sonnet 5.5 is that it's now the model used for the free tier on claude.ai . OpenAI's ChatGPT free tier uses Luna 5.6, which means Anthropic currently have a much more capable free offering. I ran this prompt against that free tier: build me an HTML page that renders a three-dimensional pelican riding a bicycle using WebGL And got back this page , which is a solid effort. Anthropic's announcement reiterates that Haiku 5.5 will be available "in the coming weeks". I really hope that one is price-competitive with GPT-6 Luna!
