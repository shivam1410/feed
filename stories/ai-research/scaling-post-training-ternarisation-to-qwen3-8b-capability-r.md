arXiv:2609.09240v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Ultra-low-bit language models promise reductions in storage and memory traffic, but a nominal "1.58-bit" label does not specify the deployed representation or its execution cost. We study a scale-up of an aggressive post-training conversion pipeline from Qwen3-4B to Qwen3-8B. The conversion uses KOTMS rotation, E2M-ATQ adaptive ternarisation, and GPTQ-style error compensation in a weight-only A16 configuration. We do not claim these algorithms as new. Our contribution is the end-to-end scale-up characterisation: an external reproduction gate, matched 4B/8B capability analysis, cross-corpus perplexity, effective-bit accounting, lossless lattice-aware packing, and direct packed execution. The 8B model reaches a three-corpus perplexity ratio of 1.361x, with WikiText-2, C4, and PTB ratios of 1.318x, 1.393x, and 1.371x. On eight zero-shot tasks at n = 500, mean accuracy is 64.6% versus 72.4% for FP16, corresponding to 78.5% chance-corrected retention and a 7.8-point absolute cost. The matched 4B run retains 69.6%, yielding an 8.9-point 8B advantage. The packed checkpoint is 8.24 GiB and preserves the recorded perplexity to measurement precision. Direct packed execution reaches 15.52 tokens/s in 7.35 GiB, while a preliminary packed GEMV remains slower than FP16 cuBLAS. The result is a validated scale-up baseline: model size improves robustness to aggressive post-training discretisation, actual serialisation is solved for the measured artefact, and direct execution is feasible, while broader seeds, calibration distributions, and kernel optimisation remain open.
