arXiv:2607.21752v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Data-adaptive sparse attention masks substantially outperform fixed patterns (e.g., BigBird and Longformer) and can even exceed dense attention on long sequences. Existing adaptive approaches---including SBM-Transformer, Dynamic Mask Attention, and NSA---typically require additional learnable parameters, custom gradient estimators, or specialized CUDA kernels. We show that classical data compression provides an effective masking signal with \textbf{no additional parameters}. By computing per-block gzip compression ratios, we identify non-redundant content blocks and route long-range attention selectively through them. Intuitively, blocks that gzip cannot compress contain information not predictable from local repetition, making them natural long-range attention targets. Because the compression profile is input-dependent, the resulting sparse mask adapts dynamically to content without learned parameters, auxiliary losses, or custom kernels. On PG-19 byte-level language modeling at 92M parameters with 8K context, our method achieves 1.71 bits-per-byte (BPB), outperforming dense attention (2.89), BigBird (2.34), Longformer (3.21), and a reimplemented SBM-Transformer (3.38)---the only learned-mask baseline---by up to 1.67 BPB while adding no parameters. The advantage grows with sequence length, with the gap over BigBird widening from 0.05 BPB at 4K context to 0.63 BPB at 8K, while convergence is 3.3$\times$ faster.
