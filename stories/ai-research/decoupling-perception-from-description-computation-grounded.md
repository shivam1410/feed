arXiv:2608.05238v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Training multimodal models to align time series with language runs into a self-supervision trap. The usual recipe asks an LLM to read a series and write a description, so label quality is capped by the perceptual skill the model is supposed to learn. The data can never teach more than the labeler already knows. A second gap makes this worse: most datasets use a single variable, but the patterns that matter (cross-channel correlation, lead-lag structure, co-occurring anomalies) appear only with several variables, right where the labeling LLM's limits are most exposed. These two problems create a trilemma: existing methods are reliable, realistic, or scalable, but none achieves all three. We resolve this by decoupling perception from description. Deterministic code computes a set of statistics from real, open-source multivariate series; the LLM verbalizes those precomputed facts. Perception, which LLMs do poorly, is handled by computation, while the LLM handles expression. This produces CGTime, our 4B-parameter computation-grounded time-series-language model. CGTime outperforms far larger general-purpose models on multivariate understanding tasks: it attains the best multivariate fact score on our held-out benchmark (0.283 vs. 0.173 for GPT-4o-mini and 0.203 for GPT-5.4-nano), a gap that survives Holm-corrected paired significance tests against every baseline. It also states verifiable numerical facts in generated captions more accurately and covers a broader range of statistical properties.
