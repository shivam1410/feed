arXiv:2609.25397v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The one-dimensional bin packing problem (1D-BPP) is a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications ranging from logistics and manufacturing to cloud resource management. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a competitive paradigm for data-driven optimization, most learned packing methods target 2D and 3D variants, and intelligent learned solvers for 1D-BPP remain scarce. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end, size-agnostic graph reinforcement learning framework for 1D-BPP. We formulate the packing process as a Markov decision process on an item-compatibility graph, serving as a structural knowledge representation in which every action merges two partial bins that fit together. A graph neural network actor-critic policy extracts relational features from this representation and is trained through reinforcement learning and decoded by stochastic beam search, enabling a single trained model to generalize zero-shot to instances of any size. We conduct a systematic empirical study across graph encoders, DRL algorithms, reward functions, training distributions, and hyperparameters. Evaluated zero-shot on the full BPPLIB benchmark against a constructive heuristic, a grouping genetic algorithm, and recent learned methods, our data-driven policy lowers the mean optimality gap of the constructive heuristic from 2.66\% to 2.31\%, with the largest gains on structured instances. Against learned baselines evaluated on the same benchmark, it attains a lower gap on most of the nine families and is far more stable across instance distributions. On the hardest benchmark family, it outperforms a state-of-the-art learned solver that relies on column generation and integer programming, while using no solver at all. A grouping genetic algorithm remains ahead overall, and we analyze where and why the residual gap arises.
