arXiv:2607.21971v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Test-time scaling through iterative self-evolution with environment feedback, as demonstrated by AlphaEvolve, shows remarkable performance gains. We hypothesize that the success of such evolution frameworks hinges on meta-skills, such as self-reflection with environment feedback, that enable effective multi-round refinement, yet are largely neglected by traditional post-training. To bridge this gap, we present MetaEvolve, a framework designed to develop these meta-skills via a data synthesis pipeline, evolution-aware reinforcement learning (RL), and inference-time evolutionary search. Concretely, we ground MetaEvolve in coding, where program execution provides natural, continuous reward signals beyond binary correctness. Building on these signals, we synthesize evolution trajectories as training data, each containing a current program, its fitness score (combining correctness and efficiency), and a history of prior attempts, and train the model via RL with verifiable rewards derived from test case execution. By training on large-scale code data, we aim to inspire generalizable domain-agnostic meta-skills that can transfer broadly to open-ended problems where such rich training signals are scarce. Across seven coding benchmarks, MetaEvolve outperforms the strongest baseline by 10.01% absolute on in-distribution tasks and 24.12% on out-of-distribution tasks. On open-ended algorithm optimization problems entirely outside the training domain, it further achieves a 46.9% relative improvement. These results demonstrate that explicitly cultivating self-evolution meta-skills offers a principled path toward more capable and autonomously self-evolving AI.
