arXiv:2609.02170v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Advertising recommendation requires continuously tuning complex system parameters while balancing commercial returns and user experience. Recent work has introduced large language models (LLMs) with skill documents to assist this labor-intensive process, but skill optimization remains largely prompt-driven, lacking a principled mechanism to attribute rewards to specific document edits. To address this limitation, we propose Document-Mediated Reinforcement Learning (DMRL), a skill self-evolution framework that models skill document optimization as a sequence of structured editing actions. In DMRL, an upper-level agent performs controlled document edits, while a frozen lower-level task agent evaluates their effects through A/B testing. To address credit assignment and long-term outcomes, we introduce two key components: (1) Dual-Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a post-training policy optimization method for robust and risk-aware advantage estimation; and (2) Long-term Reward Predictor (LRP), which estimates long-term outcomes by modeling population heterogeneity with disentangled representation learning and cross-attention transfer. DMRL was deployed on a large-scale short-video ads platform and extensive empirical evaluation shows that DMRL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across key advertising metrics
