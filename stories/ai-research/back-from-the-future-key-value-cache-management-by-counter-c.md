arXiv:2607.27600v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Key-value (KV) cache management through compression and eviction strategies has emerged as an important research direction in recent years. Computational demands of large language models (LLMs) and their multi-modal variants during output generation can be partially alleviated by caching previous key and value calculations needed by subsequent scaled dot-product attention operations. However, this leads to another problem: the size of the resulting KV cache grows linearly with context length and quickly consumes all available GPU memory when either the prompt or the generated output are long. KV cache management periodically prunes entries from the cache thereby reducing its memory footprint while attempting to retain sufficient information for accurate generation. A by-product is faster inference speed. We propose a simple yet effective KV eviction scheme motivated by the insight that past tokens which can be well-predicted from more recent tokens are redundant and their associated keys and values can be removed from the cache. To score entries for eviction we run the model on the tokens in their original order, reusing the key and value representations already stored in the KV cache, and applying a counter-causal attention mask so that each position attends only to its future context. This is in-distribution, tied directly to the actual cache contents, and requires no additional training. To further reduce cost, we additionally propose a fast single-layer approximation that restricts the counter-causal pass to the last transformer layer, achieving a significant speedup per refresh cycle at marginal accuracy cost. We evaluate our strategy on various open-source LLMs and benchmark datasets showing competitive or improved performance over other state-of-the-art methods.
