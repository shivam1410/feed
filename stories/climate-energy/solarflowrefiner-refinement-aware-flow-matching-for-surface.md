arXiv:2609.22126v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: High-resolution surface solar radiation (SSR) is important for solar forecasting and grid operation. However, physically consistent reanalysis products are too coarse to resolve localized cloud-driven variability. In this paper, we study a multisource downscaling task that reconstructs high-resolution SolarCube SSR fields from coarse ERA5 radiative variables and co-registered satellite channels. The task is challenging because a single ERA5 grid cell may contain both sunlit and cloud-shadowed regions. As a result, the missing high-resolution correction can be spatially sharp and inherently ambiguous. One-stage predictors often oversmooth these structures. Post-hoc refinement also introduces a stage-wise mismatch: the generator is optimized independently, even though its output determines the refiner's initial state. We introduce SolarFlowRefiner, a refinement-aware flow-matching framework for SSR downscaling. A conditional FlowMatch generator first predicts a normalized correction to an upsampled ERA5 baseline. The refiner is then trained on prediction-conditioned states between the current FlowMatch output and the target residual. This exposes the refiner to the structured errors produced by the generator. The refinement objective is also backpropagated through the FlowMatch sampler, allowing generation and correction to be jointly optimized for the final reconstruction. Experiments on a day-blocked ERA5--SolarCube benchmark show consistent improvements over standalone generation and post-hoc refinement. More broadly, SolarFlowRefiner provides a general strategy for coupling generative predictors with iterative correctors.
