arXiv:2609.25433v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Modern production-scale recommender systems rely on complex, multi-task ranking models. Introducing new prediction tasks into these massive systems often causes bottlenecks - it risks negative task conflicts with existing tasks, and can lead to long development and experimentation cycles due to the expensive retraining of backbone models and downstream models or tuning of reward combination formulas. To address the critical challenge of slow experimentation velocity, we introduce the Lightweight Ranking Heads (Light Heads) framework. Designed for continuous online learning environments, Light Heads enable the dynamic injection of new tasks into existing multi-task ranking models, effectively obviating the need for model cold-starting and retraining of backbone models. By utilizing stop-gradients and stateless daily training, this design strictly isolates new tasks, mitigating the risk of adverse task conflicts. Crucially, this framework uses a centralized configuration that allows Light Heads to be added to multiple models simultaneously, unblocking faster training data generation and co-training of downstream models. Successfully deployed at YouTube scale, this approach reduces the iteration cycle for multi-task experimentation from several weeks to days. In this paper, we detail the system architecture, analyze the training dynamics of stateless cold-started heads, compare their performance to full heads, and demonstrate how Light Heads have enabled the rapid A/B experimentation and deployment of new ranking tasks that yield measurable production value.
