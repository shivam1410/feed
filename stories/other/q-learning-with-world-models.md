arXiv:2608.17163v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) has become increasingly sample-efficient, enabling applications such as RL fine-tuning of Vision-Language-Action models into reliable, high-performing policies. World models offer a further lever for sample efficiency, as they predict state changes rather than actions alone, but their success has largely been confined to supervised policy learning. Prior model-based RL methods often optimize the policy or value function directly on imagined rollouts, which is prone to compounding bias and struggles to scale to large, high-dimensional problems such as real-world robotics, a problem that worsens with task horizon and visual complexity. In this work, we instead ask whether we can leverage world models directly on top of standard Q-learning to improve performance, while remaining trained and grounded in the real, online setting. We propose QWM, a framework that leverages world models to perform test-time search over imagined trajectories on top of Q-learning to select high-value actions during both online rollouts and evaluation. Since the policy and value function are trained only on real transitions, QWM avoids compounding model bias while still gaining the sample-efficiency benefits of predictive search. On challenging manipulation benchmarks Robomimic and LIBERO, QWM significantly outperforms strong prior state-of-the-art methods on both sample efficiency and performance.
