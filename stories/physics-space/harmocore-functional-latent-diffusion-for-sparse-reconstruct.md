arXiv:2609.00679v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Reconstructing oscillatory wave fields from scattered sensors is a severely underdetermined inverse problem. Beyond the challenges of general physical-field reconstruction, wave responses are complex-valued, frequency-sensitive, and highly oscillatory, while costly simulation and sensing often leave only extreme-sparse observations. Existing low-rank, operator, and diffusion approaches are largely designed for real-valued, smoother fields; dense pixel-space diffusion is particularly inefficient for oscillatory complex fields and difficult to scale to 3D. We propose HarmoCore, which places a generative prior in a compact, continuous, and structured wave-field latent. HarmoCore represents joint real--imaginary channels with Functional Tucker cores over shared continuous spatial bases, learns a frequency-conditioned core diffusion prior, and performs Diffusion Posterior Sampling directly in core space. At fixed sensor coordinates, the multilinear decoder induces an explicit likelihood guidance operator, avoiding dense pixel-space correction. Optional target-equation residual guidance further promotes physical consistency. Experiments on 2D Helmholtz, 2D synthetic wave fields, and 3D Helmholtz show substantial gains under 1%--2% sensing while remaining practical in three dimensions.
