arXiv:2608.05989v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Sample-efficient policy learning from pixels is a long-standing challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Recent dynamics-based representation learning methods have significantly improved the sample efficiency of model-free visual RL by learning dynamics-aware representations through auxiliary prediction performed either in latent space (self-prediction) or observation space (observation prediction). However, state-of-the-art methods from both categories still struggle on challenging visual control tasks when training data is limited. We posit that relying on either predictive objective alone may be insufficient. In contrast, observation prediction grounds learned representations in observation-level dynamics, but does not directly regularize the temporal predictability of latent representations over extended horizons. In this paper, we propose Observation-Grounded Self-Predictive Representations (OG-SPR), a model-free visual RL algorithm for continuous control that learns representations that are both temporally predictive in latent space and grounded in observation-level dynamics. OG-SPR incorporates two core auxiliary objectives: multi-step latent self-prediction and next-observation prediction. We empirically show that directly imposing latent self-prediction on the shared representation may over-constrain it and does not necessarily improve performance. To address this issue, OG-SPR introduces two lightweight adapters for latent self-prediction, allowing the shared representation to benefit from temporally predictive signals without being forced to directly satisfy the self-prediction objective. Experiments on 28 visual control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite show that OG-SPR improves aggregate performance over state-of-the-art self-predictive and observation-predictive RL methods, with particularly pronounced gains in challenging domains such as dog and humanoid.
