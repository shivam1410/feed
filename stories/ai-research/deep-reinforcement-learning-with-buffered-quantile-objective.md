arXiv:2609.21327v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Quantile-based reinforcement learning provides an interpretable approach to risk-sensitive decision-making by optimizing a prescribed quantile of the cumulative-return distribution. Despite this appeal, learning under a point quantile objective is challenging: quantiles can change abruptly under small perturbations of the return distribution, and exact quantile-sensitive planning requires computationally demanding distributional optimization. Lower-buffered quantiles alleviate the former difficulty by averaging neighboring quantiles immediately below the target level, providing a smoother surrogate while preserving the underlying point-quantile objective. Existing methods based on this principle, however, remain model-based and rely on explicit return-law planning, limiting their applicability beyond small tabular problems. We develop Deep-BQRL, a model-free distributional reinforcement-learning framework that extends buffered-quantile learning to neural function approximation. The method learns conditional return quantiles directly from sampled transitions, constructs buffered action scores from the relevant region of the learned quantile function, and uses ensemble disagreement to guide exploration. An augmented input representation allows the learned policy to respond to trajectory information without explicitly reproducing the quantile-state recursion required by exact planning. Experiments on an asset-selling optimal-stopping problem and slippery FrozenLake compare Deep-BQRL with model-based UCB-BQRL and tabular PPO and TRPO implementations. In asset selling, Deep-BQRL attains smaller mean cumulative point-quantile policy gaps than PPO and TRPO at the reported target levels, while UCB-BQRL retains the smallest gaps. The learned stopping decisions also vary with the target quantile, providing an interpretable illustration of the method's risk-sensitive behavior.
