arXiv:2607.20551v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Effective molecular representation learning is crucial for accurate molecular property prediction. Recently, numerous self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches leveraging 3D GNNs have been developed to capture comprehensive 3D structural information for drug discovery. However, existing methods lack explicit physical constraints and are highly susceptible to geometric noise induced by coarse empirical force fields during large-scale pre-training.Furthermore, they overlook dynamic feature modulation during downstream adaptation, often resulting in catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer. To address these limitations, we introduce SenCos-GEM, a novel explicitly decoupled geometry-enhanced molecular representation learning framework that incorporates SENet-calibrated and law-of-cosines-constrained enhancements. SenCos-GEM employs a physics-guided geometric consistency loss based on the law of cosines to derive high-fidelity and mathematically invariant 3D spatial priors. In addition, lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules are integrated into the backbone as task-specific adapters, while a dual-modulation prediction head combines Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) and SENet mechanisms to enable dynamic feature recalibration. SenCos-GEM demonstrates highly competitive performance across diverse classification and regression tasks on MoleculeNet benchmark, establishing new state-of-the-art results specifically on 3D conformation-sensitive regression tasks, such as FreeSolv, Lipophilicity, and QM9, achieving relative error reductions of 12.9% (RMSE), 5.3% (RMSE), and 8.2% (MAE), respectively. Moreover, our model exhibits superior capability in distinguishing stereoisomers and discriminating conformational perturbations, underscoring its robust spatial modeling performance. Collectively, SenCos-GEM represents a significant breakthrough in accurate molecular property prediction.
