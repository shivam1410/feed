Drug toxicity prediction is critical for reducing late-stage attrition in drug discovery, yet remains challenging due to severe class imbalance, scaffold-based generalization, and the clinical need for interpretable predictions. Single-modality approaches-SMILES Transformers or graph neural networks capture complementary aspects of molecular structure, while sequence-only models cannot directly provide graph-attributed explanations. We present SMILESGNN, a multimodal architecture that fuses a SMILES Transformer encoder and a GATv2 graph encoder via cross-attention, and SMILESGNN-PT, a variant using a ChemBERTa-2 pretrained backbone. The design retains an explicit graph branch within the predictive pipeline, supporting GNNExplainer-based analysis of substructures associated with toxic predictions. On ClinTox, SMILESGNN achieves AUC-ROC 0.987 and F1 0.906 with only 0.4M parameters, performing competitively with a strong SMILESTransformer and a larger ChemBERTa-2/GATv2 concat-fusion baseline. On Tox21 (12 tasks), SMILESGNN-PT obtains mean AUC-ROC 0.750, comparable to ChemBERTa-2 alone and the same-backbone concat-fusion baseline. Overall, the results suggest that cross-attention is a practical fusion alternative that preserves competitive predictive performance while enabling graph-based interpretability support.
