arXiv:2609.00530v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recovering compact explicit solutions from neural approximations is challenging when imperfect teacher data guide symbolic topology search and coefficient estimation. We present DeSyR, a decoupled symbolic recovery framework for differential equations. A physics-informed neural network guides repeated searches to construct candidate topologies with provisional constants. Once a topology is fixed, its coefficients are refined solely from the governing equation and prescribed constraints, followed by gated selection and verification. For linear fixed-topology parameterizations, we characterize teacher-error inheritance and show that finite-weight mixed data--physics fitting retains an $O(\beta^{-1})$ teacher-dependent contribution when the teacher error projects onto the model space. Under well-posedness, representability, zero-residual attainment, and discrete determinacy, physics-only refinement conditionally recovers exact coefficients; for nonlinear parameterizations, the corresponding guarantees are local. DeSyR is evaluated on 15 differential-equation problems across 18 configurations covering high-order, space--time, multidimensional, nonlinear, and coupled systems. A candidate-level audit yields a 99.23% convergence rate among free-parameter refits, while every selected refinement involving free coefficients converges. Configuration-level median refined relative $L_2$ errors are $2.31\times10^{-14}$ or lower. In same-topology comparisons, refinement reduces error by eight to fourteen orders of magnitude. These results show that an approximate neural teacher can guide topology discovery without imposing its error scale on final recovered coefficients, provided a target-capable topology is retained and physics-only refinement converges.
