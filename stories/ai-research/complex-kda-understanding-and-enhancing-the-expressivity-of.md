Linear RNNs based on the delta-rule enable efficient sequence modeling, but their linear updates with a low-rank correction constrain their expressivity. Prior work has shown that composing two delta-rule transitions in a single recurrent update can model a 2D rotation, but this increases the rank and the cost of the updates compared to a single transition. We show that Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) can realize 2D rotations by combining a single delta-rule transformation with a second reflection supplied by its channel-wise gate. This requires extending the parameter ranges of KDA by combining two existing range extensions: allowing gates in [-1,1] and the delta-rule coefficient β in [0,2]. We call the resulting model Complex KDA (CKDA). It preserves KDA's stability and efficiency, with transitions that remain diagonal-plus-rank-one and non-expansive, while reaching the state-tracking expressivity of DeltaProduct_2. We characterize the expressivity of CKDA and prove that every orthogonal diagonal-plus-rank-one matrix is exactly a CKDA transition matrix. A single CKDA layer can track every finite group isomorphic to a subgroup of SO(3), and many state-tracking results use one fewer layer for CKDA compared to other diagonal-plus-rank-one Linear RNNs. Empirically, combining both extensions yields the strongest length extrapolation among tested KDA range settings on S_3, S_4, and periodic audio continuation. In language modeling, CKDA outperforms Transformers and other linear RNNs, obtains similar results to a KDA baseline, and shows promising scaling behavior.
