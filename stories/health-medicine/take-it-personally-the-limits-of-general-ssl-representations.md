arXiv:2608.14675v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: While Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) effectively extracts general representations from noisy, unconstrained physiological signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG), its suitability for highly subjective tasks remains unproven. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of PPG-based SSL for real-life intense emotion detection. First, we pretrain a Real-Life PPG encoder (RL-PPG) on unconstrained, real-life data. As a rigorous sanity check, we demonstrate that these representations transfer exceptionally well to an objective physical activity recognition task, yielding almost 5-fold increase in performance over baselines in a leave-one-subject-out evaluation (LOSO). However, when applied to a~subjective real-life emotion detection task, these same general representations fail to surpass naive baselines under the LOSO protocol. Using an Across-Time validation strategy, we establish that incorporating an individual's personal data during fine-tuning is the main driver of predictive performance, outweighing the benefits of population-level pretraining. Ultimately, our findings indicate that in the evaluated scenario, general SSL representations may be insufficient for subjective affective inference, suggesting that personalization is likely a key component for real-world emotion recognition. To support future research, we share the code and pretrained RL-PPG~encoder~weights.
