Scientific instruments require accurate calibration to convert detector signals into reliable physical observables. Conventional calibration procedures typically rely on dedicated calibration measurements, analytical response models or labelled reference data, limiting their ability to adapt to changing operating conditions and detector aging. We present a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework that jointly performs wire calibration and interaction position reconstruction in Multi-Wire Parallel Plate Avalanche Counters (MWPPACs) without requiring labelled position measurements or dedicated calibration runs. The method formulates detector calibration as a latent optimization problem in which global wire gains and event-wise interaction positions are estimated simultaneously using supervision derived exclusively from detector geometry and charge-energy consistency constraints. A detector-independent neural network reconstructs sub-wire interaction positions from local charge distributions, eliminating the need to assume analytical induction profiles by learning the detector response directly from experimental data. The end-to-end differentiable framework enables continuous detector self-calibration while improving the uniformity and accuracy of position reconstruction. Experimental evaluation on the entrance MWPPAC tracking detectors of the VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer demonstrates stable convergence, improved spatial homogeneity and enhanced position resolution. Beyond the detector studied, the method establishes a general framework for physics-informed self-supervised calibration of scientific instruments and is a step toward autonomous intelligent instrumentation capable of continuous adaptation during operation. In this paradigm, detector calibration is no longer a prerequisite for an experiment but an integral part of the measurement process itself.
