arXiv:2607.06640v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A learned world model is usually judged by how faithfully it reconstructs its observations or predicts reward, as though quality were something the model simply has or lacks. But what a task actually needs from a model is narrower: the few predictive coordinates its queries depend on, which we call the closure. We show that how much of that closure a latent comes to represent is set not by the model's capacity or its observations but by the dimensionality of the objective it is trained against, and we measure this directly on a DreamerV3 stack in a controlled environment with known ground-truth closure. An aligned scalar value signal -- the objective at the heart of value equivalence -- installs only a one-dimensional projection of a closure that needs several dimensions: read through a single linear probe, the recoverable structure rises from R^2=0.10 to 0.76 as the scalar is replaced by the full objective. Sweeping the objective's dimensionality from one to four installs exactly that many predictive directions through an auxiliary head, and the same staircase appears -- at attenuated magnitude but the same rank -- through the model's own value head, so the dissociation is dimensional rather than an artifact of head form. Capacity-matched comparisons and in-situ pressure checks rule out the obvious alternatives. The law governs a regime, and we measure its boundary: on a companion closed-loop task whose structure is observable frame by frame, reconstruction installs that structure and the scalar objective suffices -- the objective decides what a latent represents exactly where cheaper training signals cannot already recover it. Value equivalence is thus not all-or-nothing but dimensional: the familiar single-reward objective is its rank-one corner, and a model installs as much of a task's structure as the objective it is asked to predict.
