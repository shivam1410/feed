arXiv:2609.16415v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Pedestrian-count forecasting supports pedestrian-oriented Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), including crowd monitoring, pedestrian-traffic staffing and routing, and proactive risk mitigation during surges. Recent time-series foundation models (FMs) report strong zero-shot accuracy on heterogeneous forecasting benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether these gains transfer reliably to pedestrian sensing deployments. We benchmark seven univariate forecasting approaches spanning four paradigms: Seasonal Naive, gradient-boosted trees (LightGBM, CatBoost), deep learning models (N-HiTS, PatchTST), and two pretrained FMs (TimesFM, Chronos-2). Experiments cover two complementary regimes: (i) a five-day special event dataset SAIL2025 at 3-minute resolution with limited in-domain history; and (ii) Melbourne pedestrian sensors as a multi-year hourly dataset (2010--2017) with strong seasonality. We compare the MAE and RMSE results per sensor across datasets and multiple forecast horizons. Results show three consistent findings. First, with limited historical data, Seasonal Naive remains a strong baseline for long-horizon forecasting on high-volume sensors, while trained models can degrade when the next day differs substantially from prior days. Second, boosted trees can be competitive on lower-volume sensors but exhibit higher sensitivity on high-volume sensors under event-driven shift. Third, FMs excel in the seasonal and data-rich regime under long-context configuration. The findings highlight the importance of choosing pedestrian forecasting models based on both the underlying data conditions and the forecasting horizon.
