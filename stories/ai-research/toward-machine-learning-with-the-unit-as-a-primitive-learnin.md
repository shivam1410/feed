arXiv:2608.25118v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Machine learning is usually formalized through samples, while the persistent individual to which multiple observed or possible events refer often remains implicit. We propose the \emph{unit} as an explicit primitive at the level of task semantics. A learning task first declares a population of persistent referents and a sameness criterion; the realized value $u$ denotes the selected referent. Supervised learning is the main formal specialization. Its semantic object is a family of unit-conditioned response laws. Homogeneity is the special case in which those laws coincide; a sample-only conditional is silent as to whether the world is homogeneous or the observed law is only the marginal of a heterogeneous family. What is learned from data is a pair $(T_\phi,R_\theta)$: a tokenizer that produces a contextual unit token and one shared response-law form that reads it. The structured class takes that form to be a simple relation in the token; a linear predictor is the running instance. The token is the learner-side representation through which the task-side unit affects prediction, while a learner specification that omits unit information is unit-insensitive; homogeneity remains a property of the world-side response family. When identity is unresolved, the world-side law mixes unit-conditioned targets, while the learner composes its shared form with a token. A trusted resolver may fix the unit and supply a lookup token; otherwise \emph{unit abduction} forms a token of the same type from factual evidence. Unlinked single-row observations can fail to distinguish a heterogeneous unit world from a homogeneous pooled world; trusted same-unit pairs separate a restricted witness. The formal results concern this supervised specialization.
