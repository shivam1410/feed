Release: datasette-upload-dbs 0.5a0 This plugin has been around for a while - it lets users upload a brand new SQLite database to a hosted Datasette instance, at which point that database will start being served by that instance. It can also be used to atomically swap a database with a more recent version. The uploaded database is saved to a file, verified, then swapped in so /name starts serving the new one. The new release adds a formalized API, so you can replace an existing database (or add a new one) like this: curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \ -H "Accept: application/json" \ -F "db=@content.db" \ -F "db_name=content" \ https://your-instance.example.com/-/upload-dbs This means you can build fresh databases in an environment such as GitHub Actions and swap them in production as soon as that build has completed.
