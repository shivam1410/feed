arXiv:2607.16256v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Dreams splice together people, places, and times that never met. Neuroscience suggests this recombination is not noise, but a function driving insight and creative discovery. This reframes memory consolidation: rather than merely defending against forgetting, its measurable value lies in recombining knowledge across experiences that have not yet co-occurred. We test this directly by isolating the recombinatory-replay mechanism and implementing it in two architecturally unrelated systems: a LoRA fine-tuning pipeline (DREAMS) and a symbolic engine replaying structured knowledge objects (SAPIENCE). Both systems converge on the same finding: cross-domain consolidation creates value, while within-domain rehearsal does not. The symbolic arm surfaces novel cross-domain connections at 85.7%, a +21 percentage point (pp) gain over baseline. The neural arm improves overall by +5.64 pp, but on subtasks explicitly requiring cross-domain transfer (like unseen math reasoning on GSM8K), gains reach +14.5 pp. This effect is a genuine property of the weights--not a prompt artifact--as prepending the same material in-context to a 671B-parameter model actually reverses the gain. We validate this prediction against documented discoveries across 50,000 real papers and state a falsifiable hippocampal-recording prediction to distinguish recombination from rehearsal. Ultimately, this principle is substrate-general, tracking real discovery at scale. Reading the literature teaches a model to recall what it has seen, but producing discovery requires a separate offline phase that recombines knowledge across domains--the computational analog of dreaming. Consolidation is not for remembering, but for discovering.
