arXiv:2609.20904v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Hybrid motor-imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) combining EEG and fNIRS can outperform EEG-only systems by exploiting complementary electrophysiological and hemodynamic information. To obtain such hybrid information when paired EEG-fNIRS acquisition is unavailable or inconvenient, recent studies have focused on EEG-to-fNIRS cross-modal generation. However, existing methods still suffer from slow generation and often require pretraining, limiting their use in real-time MI-BCI scenarios. Although one-step generative models offer an attractive route to low-latency synthesis, removing the iterative refinement process can reduce generation fidelity and introduce non-physiological artifacts. To address these problems, this paper proposes Bio-MF, a latent-free one-step MeanFlow framework for EEG-conditioned fNIRS generation. Bio-MF performs direct signal-space x-prediction, converts this signal-space output into MeanFlow velocity supervision, and completes inference with one network evaluation. To preserve task-relevant hemodynamic structure under heterogeneous sensor layouts, Bio-MF integrates Spatial-Temporal Interactive 4D Encoding, cross-modal classifier-free guidance, and noise-level-gated FFT regularization. On Dataset 1, EEG + synthetic fNIRS improves ACC over EEG-only by 3.37 and 4.15 percentage points for HbR and HbO, respectively. On Dataset 2, the corresponding gains remain 2.98 and 2.50 percentage points under the unseen 64-channel EEG montage. On an RTX PRO 6000 GPU, Bio-MF generates one fNIRS trial in 7.0 ms, corresponding to an 857x speedup over the 1000-step SCDM latency. These results show that Bio-MF enables fast EEG-to-fNIRS synthesis while preserving task-relevant generation quality for downstream hybrid MI decoding.
