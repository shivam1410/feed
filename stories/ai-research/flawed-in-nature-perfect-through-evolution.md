arXiv:2609.00129v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The performance of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models degrades when the problem they were trained on drifts. This is a near-universal feature of real-world problems, which often change unpredictably. Biological evolution has achieved intelligence by overcoming this obstacle through natural selection acting on heritable variation. AI/ML techniques have long incorporated forms of natural selection, but it has been challenging to maintain model diversity as optimization naturally drives convergence. Here we show that a swarm of AI/ML models subjected to deliberate mutations of their model coefficients away from optimality can reliably and sustainably improve performance in changing environments by acting as a statistical hedge against non-stationarity. We call this mechanism 'Flawed in Nature, Perfect through Evolution', reflecting that the collective performance gain goes at the expense of individual performance. We prove via four theorems that the resulting regret reduction is guaranteed under general conditions, establishing the Flawed-in-Nature mechanism as a generalizable design principle for AI/ML systems. We validate these results on synthetic linear regression tasks, demonstrating that the mutated swarm delivers the best model in $\sim80\%$ of environment changes and that inference synthesis successfully translates this individual advantage into a collective one. The mechanism proves to be most effective when the mutation drift rate matches the drift rate of the environment. We outline a simple, adaptive controller that enables practical applications by tuning the mutation drift rate to match the unknown drift rate of the environment. The close analogy of the Flawed-in-Nature mechanism to biological evolution suggests it may have been a critical missing ingredient for the organic discovery of AI forms that more closely mimic biological intelligence.
