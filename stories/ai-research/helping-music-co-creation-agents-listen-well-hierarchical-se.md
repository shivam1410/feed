Collaborative music agents need internal representations rich enough to support both understanding and generation, yet flexible enough for a workflow where the human retains agency. We present a hierarchical self-supervised ``world model'' for symbolic music: a 2.55M-parameter Swin V2 encoder trained on MIDI piano-roll images with JEPA-style objectives (pitch- and time-shift equivariance, masked embedding prediction, and a distributional regularizer), using no labels and no music-theory vocabulary. Probing the frozen embeddings shows that the level at which a musical property becomes decodable tracks its musical time scale: phrase boundaries are read off the coarsest levels, note density and harmonic detail off the finest. Temporal and phrase structure emerge from the self-supervised objectives alone, while harmonic content must be asked for; a small chord-supervision head raises joint chord recovery from .18 to .54, and key detection, which is never supervised, from .16 to .70. Following the Representation AutoEncoder paradigm, a conditional flow-matching model stands in for a trained decoder, flowing in pixel space from PCA-reduced conditioning: it reproduces a target window at pixel F1 0.996, and the same per-level conditioning dropout that controls how far variations stray also enables graphical prompting for masked inpainting with no inpainting-specific sampler. The pipeline runs on CPU producing a suggestion in 2.8 s, or 0.6 s on Apple MPS, which we demonstrate in a live interactive demo. In concert with an LLM-based brain, these capabilities supply the core of a collaborative music creation agent in service of, rather than in place of, human agency.
