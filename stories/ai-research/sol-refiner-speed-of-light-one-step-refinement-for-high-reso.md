High-resolution video generation is expensive, as its cost grows rapidly with the number of spatiotemporal tokens. A practical alternative first generates a lower-resolution video and then applies a refiner, but conventional multi-step refinement introduces a second sampling bottleneck. We present SoL-Refiner, a one-step video refiner that transforms low-resolution model outputs into 4K videos with a single denoising step. Our three-stage recipe combines high-resolution continual training, reinforcement learning (RL) post-training, and a final one-step distillation. We introduce Refiner-Bench, a video refinement benchmark constructed from the outputs of different video generators, and use a shared-input protocol to compare refiners at approximately 2K output resolution. At 2K, the one-step SoL-Refiner outperforms all external refiners on the VBench and UniPercept averages, while at 3840!times!2176 it improves both metrics over the three-step LTX-2.3 Refiner. With the complete acceleration stack, SoL-Refiner achieves an 8.91times speedup in refinement latency over the same baseline in our 2K latency setting.
