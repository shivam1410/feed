arXiv:2608.12447v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Trained transformer models develop privileged bases: coordinate axes whose statistics differ from the rest of the residual stream. But what kind of direction does such a basis select? We investigate the prediction direction, the unembedding direction of the token a model currently predicts, and find that it functions as a content-defined privileged anchor. Measured with respect to this anchor, residual-stream variation is geometrically and behaviorally stratified by proximity to the prediction. The stratification holds in all eighteen models tested (dense and mixture-of-experts, 7B-120B, base and instruction-tuned). A narrow, scale-invariant prediction interface concentrates readout-relevant structure, while the vast prediction-distal complement expands with model scale. Because the prediction direction sits nearly orthogonal to the principal variance axes, variance-based analyses recover this organization only partly, and the shortfall grows with prompt heterogeneity. Anchoring reveals a steep geometric gradient: prediction-proximal regions are highly structured and cluster related prompts, while the complement is flatter and anti-discriminates among prompt groups. The interface is a narrow slice but functionally decisive. Disrupting the variance directions closest to the prediction causes immediate divergence and frequent task-frame shifts; disrupting the next level down delays divergence and preserves framing. The complement is weakly readout-aligned per direction yet causally and temporally load-bearing, and behavior is driven by direction rather than magnitude. These results establish the prediction direction as a privileged anchor distinct from previously described coordinate axes, and give a geometric account of how high-dimensional computation coexists with linear readout.
