arXiv:2607.16252v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for large language models. Under a fixed rank budget, LoRA parameterizes each adapted weight through a single low-dimensional input-side pathway, which may couple heterogeneous behaviors through shared input directions and induce interference during optimization. We propose Static Orthogonal Subspace LoRA (SOS-LoRA), a drop-in extension that reparameterizes a rank-rtot update as a sum of K static (always-on, non-routed) low-rank experts. SOS-LoRA (i) decomposes the total rank across experts, (ii) applies a fixed multi-scale scaling scheme to encourage scale-separated optimization dynamics, and (iii) promotes diverse input-side directions via cross-expert orthogonal initialization and a lightweight regularizer. SOS-LoRA remains fully mergeable, adding no inference-time parameters or latency after merging. Experiments on reasoning and knowledge-intensive benchmarks (Llama 2/3), encoder-based NLU (GLUE), and math reasoning (GSM8K/MATH) show consistent gains over matched-budget LoRA baselines and recent variants.
