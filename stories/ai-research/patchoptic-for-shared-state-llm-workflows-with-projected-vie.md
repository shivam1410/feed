arXiv:2607.05483v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Agentic workflows often operate over shared, structured state. Because LLM context windows are limited, each model invocation is typically shown only the state fragment needed for the current workflow step, a pattern commonly known as progressive disclosure. Modern systems construct such model-facing views using grep-like keyword search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), abstract-syntax-tree (AST) queries, and task-specific agent skills. These methods make the read side manageable, but they do not define when a locally proposed rewrite is valid after it is applied back to the full state. The missing piece is a contract between local updates and global validity. We introduce PatchOptic, an optic-inspired interface for shared-state LLM workflows. Optics are compositional bidirectional accessors that describe how views of structured data are read and updated. PatchOptic borrows this view/update intuition and realizes it through projected reads and verified structured patches. Each workflow step declares a projected read view, an authorized write region, and a patch-source region. Beyond runtime enforcement, the same declaration yields a path-level footprint that supports delegation, sub-workflow composition, and static certificates for reordering independent steps within the same phase. We evaluate this design with PatchBench, a benchmark with 46 cases across domains. The results show that projected reads reduce reported leakage and token cost while preserving accepted-output quality under the strong actor. Runtime verification blocks declared workflow-contract violations before commit, and patch-read enforcement rejects compromised patch artifacts that use hidden sources.
