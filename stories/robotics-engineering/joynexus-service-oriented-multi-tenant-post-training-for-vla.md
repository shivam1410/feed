The post-training of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is essential due to the diversity of simulators, robot embodiments, and task objectives. Existing compute services, whether offered as direct accelerator rental or batch-workload submission, typically allocate an exclusive set of GPU and CPU resources to a single tenant. While this paradigm maximizes client flexibility, it burdens users with infrastructure adaptation, and the fixed card-hour accounting model renders short or bursty workloads both expensive for tenants and inefficient for the service provider. To address these challenges, we present JoyNexus, a unified service for multi-tenant VLA supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation. JoyNexus decouples the Training Model Service, Inference Model Service, and Environment Service, each accessed through APIs and backed by resident shared base models with tenant-specific slots. Tenants can directly invoke high-level semantic APIs for training, rollout, and evaluation, or compose custom algorithms using lower-level APIs and their assigned endpoints. Multiple tenants submit workloads concurrently; their action modules, optimizers, rollout records, and policy versions remain isolated, and the service is scheduled by the global Training Queue and Inference Queue. To further improve multi-tenant training efficiency, JoyNexus introduces group batching for heterogeneous VLA data schemas that share a compatible model-facing prefix, enabling a single shared backbone forward pass over grouped samples. Finally, we evaluate JoyNexus through workload simulation and a group-batching pipeline in a realistic embodied scenario. Results show that, compared with isolated single-tenant execution, JoyNexus reduces aggregate GPU time and improves service utilization via cross-tenant scheduling on shared resources.
